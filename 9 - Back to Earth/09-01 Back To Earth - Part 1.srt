Er, chaps, bit of an update.

169
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,799
There appears to be something bigger
than God heading straight for you.

170
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,757
-What is it?
-How do I know?

171
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,480
It's not like a commercial airliner
with writing down the side.

172
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,790
Well, do something. Get us out of here.

173
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,316
Can't. Too scared.
Can't. Look at my hands.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,391
You're scared? But you're not even
down here. You're safe.

175
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,713
Safe? I'm not safe from having to
sit here and watch my sonar screen

176
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,030
get covered in your
gloopy insides, am I?

177
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,192
I'm not safe from seeing
those terrible pictures in my head

178
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,557
of you being eaten alive and
never being able to get rid of them.

179
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,996
You just think about you, don't you?
It's always you with you, isn't it?

180
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,914
Sir, I've changed my eyeballs three
times and I can't see anything.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,389
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

182
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,595
Gone.

183
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,518
It must have been a speck on the sonar.

184
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,318
Relax. As you were.

-It's gone!

No, sir.

192
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,230
It's underneath us.

193
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,631

it might think we're a rock.

Wait, what's that?

Will you keep the noise down back there?
Can't you see I'm looking for squid?

205
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,478
I still can't see it.

206
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,270

Hang on, I'm getting you out of there.
Rimmer to the rescue, as per usual.

213
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,360
What would these
clowns do without me, eh?

214
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,954
Anyone else would probably get a
medal for this, the Eagle of Valour,

get on the cover of Minger Monthly!

You're supposed to be
manning the sonar, Rimmer.

220
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,839
-You could have got us all killed!
-Is this about you again?

221
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,629
It is, isn't it? Can't you see,
right now I need some me time?

My heart is still hammering.

223

-I don't know how I got through that.
-You wasn't even there!

224
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,358

human race is virtually extinct?

Hmm.

Look, sir. Confirmed.

essential if one day

why does mainframe
computer not function?

Lister left a bath running
in the officers' quarters.

251
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,434
We didn't find out about it
for nearly nine years.

252
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,080

two million gallons of water

Not a nice way to be woken.

One minute you're lying
in your bed snoozing,

the next you're being washed down
a corridor at 80 knots per hour.

257

The skutters still haven't
finished drying him out.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,957
Have skutters more pressing duties?

259
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,873
Duties that distract
them from these tasks?

260

-No.

-They are machines.
-That's what I said.

267
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,719
You were senior officer. It was
duty to ensure efficiency of ship.

268
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,312
How come there are two
holograms active, both hard light?

269
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,118

could only sustain one.

-Sleeps, annoys me.

271

Look, if there's one...

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,630
Besides sleeping and annoying you,
what else he do?

273
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,190
-Gets ready for bed.
-And for entertainment?

274
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,518
He irons sneezes.

he'd probably be considered a genius.

Is tragedy.
His body lives, but inside he is dead.

277
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,952
-This is your fault. You killed him.
-What did I do?

do nothing. You think only of you.

to notice, but we are in deep space,

You are to be returning home, so we
have possibility to make this happen.

-Of course, I always serious.

-Yes.

You have 24 hours
to get your affairs in order,

then you'll be offlined
and your data files erased.

292
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,995
Then your hard drive
will be fired into space

293
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,472
and when safe distance from ship,
it will be detonated by nuclear fusion.

-I do my job.

know what I'm talking about, kid?

Get me some dirt on her.

-Not particularly, Ms...

restart human race, yes?

321
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,150
And how, pray tell,
do you plan to do that?

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,320
-Isn't obvious?
-You start, I'll join in.

Well, the solution is staring you
in your stupid, fat, ferrety face.

324

We have tentacle of
dimension-migrating leviathan.

325
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,435
We take, insert into a gene reader,
you have several in medi-lab

326
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,796
and triangulate results with
power surge readings

327
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,998
and temporal displacement residues
recorded in water tank.

328
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,390
We then calculate quantum algorithm
creature produced

329
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,154
to open dimensional membrane,
then we travel multiverse.

330
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,834
Once computed,
we have key to dimensional travel,

transpose calibrations into mining laser

332
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,111

own dimension cutter.

336
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,716
Word for word what I was gonna say.

337
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,870
Hmm.

338
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,792
No way will this work.

339
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,316
I'll probably end up with your head
or someone else's legs.

340
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,030
Something always goes wrong.
I'm not building my hopes up.

341
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,474
And we begin.

342
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,239
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

343
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,711
# I'm all alone, more or less

344
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,792
# Let me fly far away from here

345
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,838
# Fun, fun, fun

346
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,595
# In the sun, sun, sun

347
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,275
# I want to lie,
shipwrecked and comatose

348
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,591
# Drinking fresh mango juice

349
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,877
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

350
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,554
# Fun, fun, fun

351
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,634
# In the sun, sun, sun

352
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,314
# Fun, fun, fun

353
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,633
# In the sun, sun, sun #
