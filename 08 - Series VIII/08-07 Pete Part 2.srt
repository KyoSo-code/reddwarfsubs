Hey-hey, this'll drive them crazy!

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,870
We found this machine that can digitise
time and we can release jets of it.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,231
It seems to have restored your hair to
a previous time period to the rest of you.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,198

- Watch this.

And this is Pete.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,151
The excitement of being free has killed him!

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,553
He really loved that bird.
It was the only thing that kept him going.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,920
I can't guarantee anything, sir, but I think
the Time Wand could bring Pete back to life.

14
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,511
Make him young and strong again.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,193

Where the hell did Barney's ugly brother come from?

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,951
From Pete, sir. Birds are descended
from dinosaurs, from the Theropod family.

several million years.

- Yeah, go on.

We're finished!

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,554
Hol we need some advice, mate. We've been cornered
by a T-Rex that was formerly a sparrow.

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,476
And the only thing that can turn it back into Woody Woodpecker
is in its stomach. What's your take on the situation?

- Yes, ma'am?

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,880
How long in the normal course of things, will it take for Pete
to pass the Time Wand out of his system?

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,199
Strangely enough, ma'am, I don't have that information in my database.

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,829
My programmers, for some insane reason,

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,439
believed that dinosaur bowel movement
frequency tables wouldn't be required. Imbeciles!

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,238
Why? What's your suggestion?

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,355
Well, the quicker we get the
Time Wand back, the better, right?

56
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,500
- Right...
- Right, So... why don't we lure Pete into the food bay

57
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,955
and get him to eat some roughage?

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,919

Yeah! All Bran, prunes, baked beans on toast.
That sort of stuff.

We can't get Lister to eat that sort of stuff
let alone a seven-ton dinosaur!

61

The more roughage,
the quicker we get the Time Wand back.

62
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,034
- Have you got any better ideas?
- Yes, I have got a better idea, actually.

Keep him quiet?
He's rampaging about the food decks,

if we can recapture the Time Wand and turn Pete
back into a sparrow before the freeze expires,

- no one need be any the wiser.
- He's right.

Of course they like curries!

of winter and his nipples don't even get hard.

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,073
A seven-ton theropod is not gonna eat

liberally coated in blood with a side order
of intestines and an extra portion of blood -

84

- No, sir.

- And if you try anything smart, you're dead.
- Yes, sir.

And if I ever, ever, ever see you
in this office again,

Did you get punishment duty, too?

173
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,879
I've got to iron 800 prison smocks.
I don't understand.

174
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,670
Why do you get punishment duty
and I get a reward?

175
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,719
800! Bliss!

176
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,518
Did you see the captain's report?

177
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,952
Did you see what it said about you? It used
the word "imbecile" four times in one sentence.

178
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,590
Oh, yeah? What were the other words
in the sentence?

179
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,194
Just your name and a dash.

180
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,842
I don't know. You make a
couple of tiny mistakes...

181
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:03,430
you give the captain a
virus that eats all his hair off...

182
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,955
then you accidentally turn a sparrow into a dinosaur

183
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,589
and you never hear the last of it!

I'm never going to make it into high command now.

It's just the people who know you who
think you're an imbecile.

186
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:19,590
Everyone else thinks you're a moron.

187
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,079
He is a good captain, though, Captain Hollister, isn't he, ey?
On the ball. Quick.

188
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,359
Quick? The only time he's quick
is when he's passing a salad bar.

189
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,277
- You do admire him, though, don't ya?
- Admire him?

190
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,718
A man who has his own cinema
pick and mix factory in his quarters?

191
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,394
A man who has a walk-in fridge?

192
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,554
Who lists as his hobbies,
chewing and swallowing?

193
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,191
You did tell me once before, though,
you respect HIM, don't ya?

194
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,680
Respect him?

195
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,391
A man whose family crest is made
up of two cream buns and a profiterole?

Yes, he is.

198
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,875
I was just talking about you, sir. I was saying
what a big fat lump of blubber I think you are

199
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,557
and how that potato virus I contracted yesterday doesn't
appear to have any strange side effects whatsoever.

You forgot this. You left it in my office.

Do you have any idea the damage that
this could cause if it got into the wrong hands?

203

Look after it!

You're there. I know you're there,
you little sod! Come on. Out! Out!

205
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,957
There's a mouse under here.
It's been scuttling around for about ten minutes.

206
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,078
- It's not a mouse, ma'am. It's Archie.
- Archie?

207
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,754
My penis. It must have escaped.

208
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,679
You know, I really going to have to get my ears syringed.
Do you know what that sounded like to me?

209
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,400
I made one.

210
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,797
Forget my ears. Maybe my whole brain
needs syringing. You made one?

211
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,190
Out of an old electron board, a loo roll,

212
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,877
some sticky-backed plastic
and an Action Man's polo-neck jumper.

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,917
Kryten, why do you want one?

214
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,076
It's so humiliating being posted to the women's
wing just because I'm genitally challenged,

215
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,954
so I decided to make
one like Mr Lister's.

216
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:45,598
The little rascal must have got bored jumping in and out
of his hoop and make a break for it during the night.

217
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,709
Well, no wonder I couldn't lure him out with a bit of cheese.
This whole thing's making sense now.

218
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,111
Just, leave this to me, ma'am.
Here, Archie. Here, boy.

- No, ma'am.

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,630
- It means you're a real man.
- It does? Why?

224
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,430
Because, now, like all men, you have
absolutely no control over your penis.

We're not going in

That could take years.

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,872
You point that thing at yourself by mistake
and you could wind up as a sperm.

231

- Is that what you want?
- Hell, no!

232
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,191
None of my suits will fit!

- Nah, guns are for wusses.

235

It's gonna be hand-to-hand combat.

A fist fight with a T-Rex?

237
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,472
Yeah, but them T-Rexes, mate, they only got
little arms, ain't they? They ain't got no reach.

00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,631
Yeah, I'll just pick it off.

Bosh!

- Can't reach anything with them little arms.
- That's probably why they're always a bit grumpy.

- What?
