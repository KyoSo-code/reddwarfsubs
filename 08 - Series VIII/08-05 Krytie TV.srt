("Stand By Your Man" by Tammy Wynette)
# Sometimes it's hard to be a woman

3
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,797
# Giving all your love to just one man

4
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,233
# You'll have bad times

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,394
# And he'll have good times

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,397
# Doing things that you don't understand

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,471
# But if you love him, you'll forgive him... #

8
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,633
(LISTER) Post's arrived.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,235
Brilliant. A bit of excitement at last.

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,476
See that? It's a beaut. One of the struts has
collapsed on me bed. I think it was those beans.

11
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,597
Oh, the mail.

12
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,711
Haven't had a chance to look.
Anything from my mates?

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't think so. There's nothing in orange
crayon with half the letters backwards.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,957
- Anything for you?
- Just the usual.

15
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,111
A couple of death threats.

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,316
And I'm in the "Reader's Digest" lucky dip.

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,998
Apparently, I'm one of the special few
selected for their lucky dip.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,519
That'll be you and the other
twelve zillion people then, will it?

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,400
I've won either a holiday in Mauritius, a soft-top
sportscar, or a fabulous matching set of egg cups.

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,519
"Scrape with a coin to discover which."

21
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,195
I've won the holiday!

22
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,680
What?

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,754
Three million years into deep space
where I can't claim it,

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,038
I go and win a smegging holiday in Mauritius!

25
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,993
- Oh, they're taking the smeg.
- What now?

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,629
I've won the Lottery as well.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,673
"To collect your cheque,

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,789
"simply bring your winning ticket to Lottery House,
24 Argyle Street." Four million!

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,474
No luck, that's my problem. No luck at all.

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,153
It's just a wind-up from the guards
to sap our morale.

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,152
- Here's one for you.
- Who from?

32
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,640
Petersen.

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,673
My God, that is tragic.

34
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,078
What's happened to him, has he died?

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,312
Died? Do you think he'd write and tell you?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,594
Yeah, you're right, you're
right. I'm not thinking straight.

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,752
He'd be too busy with his funeral
and everything, wouldn't he?

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,589
- What's happened to him?
- Something catastrophic. Hideous.

39
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,709
He's found your guitar in Starbug's wreckage
and he's sending it here.

40
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,871
Brilliant!

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,109
- Are you OK?
- Of course I'm not OK. I hate your guitar.

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,352
If I wanted to share a cell
with an irritating lump of wood,

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,506
I'd have moved in with
an Australian soap star.

44
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,516
I didn't realise you thought I was that bad.

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,230
Didn't you get a clue
that time I tried to insert it in you?

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,235
You'd have stood a better chance
if you'd used the neck end.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,471
Anyway, you were revising.
You always get a bit uptight when you're revising.

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,270
Come on, come on - what about the Om song?
That was a classic!

49
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,317
#Om.....

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,994
#om! #

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,357
People who heard that formed self-help groups.

52
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,036
Don't give me that.
They played me demo on hospital radio.

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,034
Yes, and three patients came out of comas,
packed their bags and went home.

54
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,959
Hey! The axe man is back!

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,111
You beaut!

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,552
Hang on. There's no strings.

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,996
They've confiscated the strings!

58
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,076
I feel like a man who leaps out of a plane
with no parachute

59
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,119
and lands in the hot tub at the Playboy mansion.

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,556
Why would they take me strings? It doesn't make sense.

61
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,925
Prison regs, you're not allowed
anything you can hang yourself with.

62
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,517
I wouldn't wanna hang meself
if I had me guitar strings.

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,274
I think they were thinking of me.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,196
Maybe my luck's changing. At last a break.

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,391
(GUARD) By the way, I forgot - for you.

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,714
"Because of the nature of your crime,
blah-blah-blah-blah...

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,716
"...we are willing to review your case.

68
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,556
"For this process to be successful, you would need a
record of good behaviour, and accept the consequences

69
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,954
"That a successful appeal would mean similar
amnesty for prisoner colleagues in your situation."

70
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,918
(BOTH) Yes!

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,391
Well, thanks to Kill Crazy, that was the least
enjoyable suicide mission I've ever been on.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,928
I'm standing there, right? And right in front
of me was this weird sort of mutant thing

73
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:01,033
with like, two heads
and all these tentacles.

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,192
It took one look
at me and ran off.

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,954
Why do you think it done that?

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,270
(SNIFFS)

77
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,711
You don't know what it's like being
classified as a woman, sir. The humiliation!

78
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,359
I know. I know.

79
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,989
Why should I, a series 4000 mechanoid,

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,872
have to endure the turgid monotony
of showering with the girls three times a week?

81
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,159
- Tell me that!
- It's not fair, I know. It's just that...

82
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,390
- You shower with the girls?
- Oh, it's so hideously dull, I can't describe it.

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,394
As, they stand around soaping themselves.

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,754
Their bodies all wet and foamy.

85
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,356
Can you imagine it?

86
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,432
Oh, my goodness.
We've been frozen in time again.

87
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,793
Hello?

88
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,156
Extraordinary. It must be a warp
in the time-space continuum.

89
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,358
How curious it isn't affecting me.

90
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,434
We're not frozen in time, Krytie.
We were just thinking about what you were saying.

91
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,479
It's times like this
that make me thankful I'm just a head.

92
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,353
Oi, droid boy. Oi, Next time you're in the showers,

93
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,832
why don't you, y'know? Smuggle in a camera
and film 'em, eh? Yeah, that'd be brilliant!

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,389
I haven't seen a naked woman since...

95
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,551
Well, ever.

96
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,520
Here, I'd pay ya.

97
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,877
- What do you say?
- No. I forbid it.

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,792
Yeah, me... What?

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,679
It's voyeuristic, exploitative and immature.

100
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,831
All right. Who are you?

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,038
And what have you done with our Rimmer?

102
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,031
Gentlemen, allow me to clarify my position.

103
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,114
Morally speaking, using a hidden camera
in the women's showers,

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,231
taking shots of them sudding themselves
with mounds of foam, without their permission...

105
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,995
Morally speaking -
I'm speaking morally here -

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,039
I'm all in favour!

107
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,910
However, Listy has been invited to appeal
and a scam like this could ruin it.

108
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,879
- Appeal?
- Yeah, I'm appealing.

109
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,356
That's a minority view.

110
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,797
Look, if he's successful, we can all be successful.
We've just got to be model prisoners.

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,190
Screw his appeal. I wanna see skin!

112
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,749
Yeah! What do you say, bird-tray head?

113
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,072
Are you asking me
to betray the people I live with?

114
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,055
To ignore their humanity and
reduce them to mindless sex objects

115
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,996
merely there for your moronic titillation?

116
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,958
Yes, please!

117
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,077
If you'll excuse me, I forgot who I was for a moment.

118
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,710
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm a woman and proud of it.

119
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,475
If you'll excuse, I'll be with my fellow sisters,
doing it for ourselves.

120
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,952
I'm going to make this quick and easy.
Last night, on D wing,

121
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,555
I was beaten up and mugged.

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,997
You have one chance. I'm turning
the lights off for precisely ten seconds.

123
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,798
During which, I want whoever took it...

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,675
..to return my glass eye.

125
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,560
Kill the lights.

126
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,430
Ten...nine...eight...

127
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,353
- ..seven...six...
- (CLUNK!)

128
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,354
I'm glad to see good sense prevailed.

129
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,069
I have a date with Miss Patricia Carling
from Supplies on Saturday night.

130
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,073
She thinks my eyes are my loveliest feature.

131
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,629
If I go like this, I'm only half lovely!

132
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,159
If it's not returned within 30 seconds,
all Canary privileges suspended. One month.

133
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,676
I know who stole your left peeper, sir.

134
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,789
It was him, sir. I saw him playing marbles
with it this morning, sir.

135
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,798
 - Thank you, Rimmer.
- (CLUNK!)

136
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,434
Have you gone mad? You don't rat
on other inmates. It's an unwritten law.

137
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,673
Look, if it helps the appeal,
what else matters? Model prisoners.

138
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,274
Would the sky really fall in
if people just tidied up a little?

139
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
They're here! They've landed!

140
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,474
- Who have?
- The invisible aliens.

141
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,678
- Look! There's one.
- And there's another.

142
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,357
Agh!

143
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,832
From the people who brought you
"Vampire Bikini Girls Suck Paris",

144
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,514
comes another cinematic masterpiece.

145
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,109
- Marvel at the special effects! Marvel at the high fidelity sound!
- Looks like another pearler!

146
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
Why do they always show us these lousy B-movies?

147
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,119
To sap our morale.
Next week, it's the George Formby season.

148
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,751
(AS FORMBY) Get your hanging rope now
while there's still some left! Wahey!

149
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,679
Good evening.

150
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,199
Tonight's scheduled feature has been cancelled and replaced
by a special live pay-per-view event

151
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,352
brought to you courtesy of Krytie TV.

152
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,991
Transmitting live by my optical receptors,
we bring you live and lithe,

153
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,231
Women's Shower Night!

154
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,198
(CHEERING)

155
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,797
Are they really gonna show this? No way!
This is a joke, right? This is a...

156
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,400
- Oh, Mama!
- You know what this means, don't you?

157
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,551
There is a god?

158
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
They got to him. They reprogrammed Kryten.

159
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,156
(SILENT)

160
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,301
If we get caught watching this
your appeal's dead in the water.

161
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,737
- Forget the appeal.
- I already have!

162
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:17,316
I'm on about Kris, she's never
gonna believe I wasn't involved in this.

163
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,800
We've got to stop it.

164
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,998
- You're right. I want no part of this.
- Me neither.

165
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,151
- We've gotta go.
- Right now.

166
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,391
- Not a minute to lose.
- I'm dust.

167
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,313
Me, too. After two.

168
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,120
One, two... Go!

169
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,119
And now, I'm gonna stare at a cracked floor tile.

170
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,078
What's he doing that for?

171
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,120
Remember - shower night
is a pay-per-view event.

172
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,920
Start filling those buckets!

173
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,396
(CLATTERING COINS)

174
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,073
I can't believe this. He's running it like a business.
There's even a bloke over there selling ice creams.

175
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,799
Never mind him. Now!

176
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,713
- We've gotta go right now.
- I'm going, I'm going...

177
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,513
Now, let's get up close and personal with
one of the showerees, Miss Kristine Kochanski.

178
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,991
Fancy a choc ice?

179
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,756
OK. Splendid.

180
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,436
- Later.
- Mr Kryten. Visitor, sir.

181
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,480
Kryten. Look, I know Kill Crazy's reprogrammed you -
turned you into a ruthless entrepreneur -

182
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,995
but I think I know how to change you back.

183
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,470
Well, keep it to yourself, sir.

184
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll make it worth your while.

185
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,712
Can't you see what it's done to you!

186
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,630
It's made me rich, feared and
respected. I'm loving every minute of it.

187
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:10,236
I've just bought the rights to the
5-a-side soccer tournament today.

188
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,231
Tomorrow, I'm hoping
to get the boxing.

189
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,563
Ah, Miss Kochanski! Good to
have you back. I've a little gift for you.

190
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:17,633
Ooh, another one?

191
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,796
Nothing's too good for you, ma'am. You know you were
worried about picking up verrucas in the shower room?

192
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,871
Well, I've got the perfect solution -

193
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,156
a waterproof pogo stick.

194
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,800
This has got to stop.

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,874
But the pogo stick could put the ratings
through the roof, sir!

196
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,873
Think of the money! Think of the show!

197
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,432
I'm crazy about her.
I'm not gonna let you do this.

198
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,159
Do what?

199
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,914
How do you think Kryten got all this?

200
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,235
"Shower Night Live." Oh, God,
is he paying some of the girls to do this?

201
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,912
Who's that with the sponge?

202
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,031
That's me!

203
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,714
It replaced the Wednesday night movie.

204
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,316
I saw the whole thing -
all three terrible hours of it.

205
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,393
- It was awful.
- Is that the time?

206
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,235
I've got a merchandising meeting
in two minutes. Excuse me.

207
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,472
You are dead, nickel-hydride breath!
And you...

208
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,313
What have I done?

209
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,630
You were there for three hours of it.

210
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,235
Yeah, but I didn't enjoy it. I was outraged.

211
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,156
- Why do you think I only had one choc ice?
- How could you go along with this?

212
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,517
I'm only human. You were completely naked.

213
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,876
Starkers. Nude.

214
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,350
In the buff. Totally kitless.

215
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,272
You had no clothes on.

216
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,909
You've seen me with no clothes on when we went out.

217
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,198
Yeah, but I wanted to see
if anything had changed.

218
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,916
So, why didn't you just ask
instead of filming me in secret?

219
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,630
- Cause, you'd have said no.
- Not necessarily.

220
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,604
If I'd known it meant that
much to you that you needed to

221
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:05,432
see me naked so badly, I
wouldn't necessarily have said no.

222
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,554
- You wouldn't?
- No. We're friends, aren't we?

223
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,799
It never occurred to me that I could just ask.

224
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,635
You're such a great friend.
I love being your friend.

225
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,110
- Kris...
- No! Not now.

226
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,590
And now... not ever.

227
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,435
- But you just said...
- We're not friends any more.

228
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,992
Appeal applications, Listy. Character testimonials!

229
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,551
- What's this?
- Kris found out about the shower thing.

230
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,793
- She went ballistic. Just a little a present to say sorry.
- A bag of flour?

231
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,349
No, two bags.

232
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,033
I'm in the Tank, in the middle of deep space.
I can't just get on the blower to Interflora, y'know?

233
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,191
Flour. Flours.

234
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,554
- It's the closest I could get.
- You romantic fool.

235
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,271
Do you know how hard it is getting this stuff?
I had to nick this from the bakery. She'll appreciate that.

236
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,512
I can just see her reading the card: "Dear Kris,

237
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,232
"I'm really sorry for ogling you and the girls in the
shower yesterday for three gobsmacking hours of steamy fun.

238
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:35,272
"To make up for it, and to indicate how truly
sorry I am, here's two bags of self-raising.

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,755
"Something I didn't need any help with
yesterday."

240
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,640
It's easy for you, you're not crazy about her.
It's really debilitating being nuts about someone.

241
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,713
You lose 20 IQ points
every time you talk to them.

242
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,475
You must be nuts about a
fair few people, then are you?

243
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,873
The girls found out about "Shower Night". They
attacked me, cleaned out my system and kicked me out.

244
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,919
I've been reclassified as a man.

245
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,831
I feel terrible, sir, for endangering your appeal.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,753
It's not your fault, Kryten. They got to you.

247
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,836
- I presume you've heard the news about Miss Kochanski?
- What news?

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,071
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

249
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,576
- The news.
- What news?

250
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,856
- You haven't heard the news?
- Heard what news?

251
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,076
- No one's told you?
- Told me what?

252
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,800
- About Miss Kochanski.
- What about Miss Kochanski?

253
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,728
About Miss Kochanski
and her ex-boyfriend Tim.

254
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,954
What about Miss Kochanski
and her ex-boyfriend Tim?

255
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,999
- I can't believe you don't know!
- Know what?!

256
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,878
- No one told you?
- Told me what?!

257
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,035
You mean to say you're standing there blissfully unaware
of the news about Miss Kochanski and her ex-boyfriend Tim?

258
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,197
What news about about Miss
Kochanski and her ex-boyfriend Tim?

259
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:52,999
I don't believe it!

260
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,231
Believe what?!

261
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,830
I'm so traumatised no one's had the guts to tell you the
horrible, terrible, terribly, appallingly hideous, awful news.

262
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,879
I'm not sure I can even speak now. Heurgh!

263
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,670
Kryten, there's a 200-foot drop down there.
Now tell me the news.

264
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,737
Well, she's started
going out with Tim again.

265
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,870
He's taking her to the officer's club tonight.
Probation permits it provided she's back by 10.

266
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,192
Oh! This is all down
to that shower thing, isn't it?

267
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,436
Well, you know what Tim's like, sir - impossibly
handsome, oozes charm, a great lover,

268
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,399
and you're just... you.

269
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,877
(WAILS) It's so unfair!

270
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,711
You must feel awful.

271
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,679
Well, I do now. God!

272
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,710
- You're taking this very well, sir. I'm really impressed.
- No, I'm not, man. I'm falling apart.

273
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,713
I know that, but I was just trying to cheer you up.

274
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,839
- What can I do?
- You've gotta deal with your grief, man.

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,879
A break-up is very much like a bereavement.

276
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,193
It's usually followed by a cremation
and some sandwiches.

277
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,470
You haven't got a clue what
you're on about, have you?

278
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,917
Mark my words, time is a great healer,

279
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,074
unless you've got a rash, in which
case you're better off with ointment.

280
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,446
Look, they haven't seen each other for ages.
They're only going out for a meal.

281
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,234
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

282
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,711
How's this, Listy?

283
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,912
A little wine, a little laughter,
then back to his place for coffee and a game of chess.

284
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,596
Before you know it, she's sandwiched
between two bishops,

285
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,991
and the queen's exposed
to an attack from the rear.

286
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,600
It's a tragedy!

287
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,986
What are you so bothered about?

288
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,515
I thought you hated the idea of
me and her getting it together?

289
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,435
That was the old me, sir.
I've grown and matured since then.

290
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,310
No, the new me wants you to have children
so I can iron those itty-bitty little socks.

291
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,031
You're not getting any younger, sir,
and neither are your sperms.

292
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,635
I'm getting worried about those guys.

293
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,795
Any older, and they'll need a Stanner stairlift
to get up the Fallopian tubes!

294
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,576
So what do you propose?

295
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,326
We nail that horny stag and get you and the divine
Miss K together. It's my way of saying sorry.

296
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,912
But nothing that's gonna
endanger the appeal.

297
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,071
First, we sabotage the date.

298
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,110
- We? You mean you wanna help me?
- Step onboard the Love Express, sir!

299
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,873
Now, we get to his quarters
through the air-vents. I paid off the guards.

300
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,150
Then you make him look like the nerdiest slob
in the entire universe. This is what you'll leave in his quarters.

301
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,439
A half-eaten onion sandwich.
That's always a passion-killer.

302
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,269
Is it? I like those.

303
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,796
Then there's this. "Morris Dancer Monthly".

304
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,589
What a total dweebo nerdmeister
he'll look with those!

305
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,274
They're mine.

306
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,518
Then there's these.
Tragically unfashionable underpants.

307
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,591
They're mine.

308
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,919
And finally, Christian rock music.

309
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,118
If that doesn't scare her off, nothing will.

310
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,715
Have you been going through my things?

311
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,439
And not forgetting...

312
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,352
- A pair of scissors?
- This is the piéce de résistance.

313
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,558
Frank Assisi and the Apostles. "Hymns in Rock".

314
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,358
(CHOIR) # Kum ba yah, my Lord! #

315
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,840
Digestive biscuit.

316
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,278
(SIZZLING)

317
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,754
(UNDOES ZIP)

318
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,355
(SNIPPING)

319
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,073
The love assassin. Pow, pow, pow!

320
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,272
(LAUGHTER)

321
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,513
(LAUGHTER)

322
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,753
What Mr Lister doesn't know, of course, is that he's been set up by Krytie TV.

323
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,597
Ssh. Here he comes now.

324
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,107
- Mr Lister...
- Kryten, is that you?

325
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,957
You trashed that room because you believed
Miss Kochanski was dating Tim, didn't you?

326
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,679
- What, you mean she isn't?

327
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,400
Look whose quarters you really trashed!

328
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,076
(LAUGHTER)

329
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,118
You said the girls had restored you
back to normal?!

330
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,590
Whoops! You've been Krytered!

331
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,231
- I've wrecked Ackerman's quarters!
- (SCREAMS) The appeal!

332
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,751
The surprises haven't finished yet here on Krytie TV,

333
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,879
because Mr Ackerman and his red-hot date
are due back any second.

334
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,192
Sir, it's a race against time!
Start cleaning that room!

335
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,351
(LAUGHTER)

336
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,356
Sorry to keep droning on about this,
but what about...

337
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,115
- (SCREAMS) ..the appeal?!
- Smeg!

338
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,792
Smeg!

339
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,080
Agh!

340
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,991
(CHEERING)

341
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,838
Thanks for watching, folks. See ya next time!

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,719
- There he is.
- Kryten, come here a minute.

343
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,113
- I was just trying to boost the ratings, sir.
- Get him, and get him back to the Tank!

344
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,114
- It was nothing personal!
- (CHEERING)

345
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,191
The appeal.

346
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,989
Oooh...

347
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,515
Yes!

348
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,632
"Dear Mr Lister,
your appeal has been successful.

349
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,236
"From this day, all inmates with no records
of violence or depression

350
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,109
"will be allowed... to have strings
on their guitars."

351
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,760
This appeal was all about guitar strings?

352
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,959
You didn't think it was
about getting out of here, did ya?

353
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,240
You mean to day I've been busting my balls
so you can have strings on your lousy, stinking guitar?!

354
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,391
You've been a brick, man.

355
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,710
And as a personal thank you...

356
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,280
..I thought I'd write you a song.

357
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,669
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

358
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,992
# I'm all alone, more or less

359
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,198
# Let me fly far away from here

360
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,113
# Fun, fun, fun

361
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,671
# In the sun, sun, sun

362
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,549
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

363
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,599
# Drinking fresh mango juice

364
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,071
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

365
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,914
# Fun, fun, fun

366
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,675
# In the sun, sun, sun

367
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,639
# Fun, fun, fun

368
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,794
# In the sun, sun, sun #
