("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,593
Have you figured out a way
to get us out of here yet, Hol?

3
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,392
I have, actually, Dave. I've devoted all my run-time
to looking for a loophole in the prison regs,

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,997
and I think I've come up with something which means you
can serve your entire two-year sentence

5
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,719
in just 14 weeks.

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,393
Oh, brilliant! What have I got to do?

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,949
Become a dog.

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,193
- A dog?
- According to my data banks,

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,637
dog years are seven times shorter
than human years.

10
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,236
As a plan you can't fault it on its mathematics.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,153
No, but maybe you can fault
it on the fact I'm not a dog.

12
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,473
Yeah, but according to a 20th-century newspaper
called "The National Enquirer",

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,870
the operation's quite straightforward,

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,635
A roverostomy, they call it.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,359
Here's a photograph here
of a bloke who had it done.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,279
That's a dog!

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,716
See how convincing it is?

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,030
Even you're fooled.

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,238
Become a dog. That is without doubt the stupidest,
crappiest, most pathetic plan you've come up with all week.

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,711
Give me a chance - it's only Monday.

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,271
(BEEP)

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,950
What happened to my life -
career, prospects, friends?

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,033
I had everything and I threw it all away. It's a tragedy.

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,430
What are you on about? You had none of that stuff.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,558
You're right. I had none of that stuff.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,111
I had absolutely nothing and I threw it all away.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,191
It's an even bigger tragedy.

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,035
Look, We're only going to get through this
by being positive, by being...

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,831
What's that word women tennis players always
used to reckon was so important - begins with C?

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,514
Cunnilingus?

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,595
Centred. By being centred, focused.

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,716
It's only two years. What with good behaviour, it'll probably be 18 months.

33
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,716
Remember when you were first born,
and then you were 18 months?

34
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,694
The time just flashed past.

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,357
it flashed past 'cause you had two breasts big as
your head at your beck and call day and night.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,193
Give me that now, and I wouldn't be whinging.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,154
- What's this?
- Canary outfits and first meeting information.

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,877
I volunteered for the Canaries.

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,635
- Some bloke came round the machine shop, so I signed up.
- For the Canaries?

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,795
Yeah. Bit of close-part harmony. You should see
the list of privileges you get. Unbelievable.

41
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,830
- You don't know what the Canaries are do you?
- Yeah, course I do. It's a singing troop. A cappella.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,833
# You are the sunshine of my life

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,559
# Ooh

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,315
# That's why I'll always be around... #

45
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,671
They're nothing to do with singing, are they?
Holly lied to me, didn't he?

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,274
He was taking the smeg!

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,398
Oh, Listy.

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,479
Listy, Listy, Listy.

49
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,314
Well, go on, then. What have I signed up for?

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,077
In the 19th century, when miners went down
a pit, they'd lower a canary down first in a little cage.

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,153
What, and make them do some mining?

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,192
They were sick
in the 19th century, weren't they, eh?

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,795
I mean, how much coal can a little canary get?

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,840
And if the atmosphere was noxious, as it
frequently was... guess what the canary did?

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,991
Complained to the foreman?

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,711
It died, Listy.

57
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,432
The canary's job was to go into the most
dangerous, unpleasant and smeggy situations,

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,551
and see if it could stay alive, then they'd know
if it was safe to send in the important people.

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,634
- Oh, I'm gonna kill him!
- How come you've never heard of the Canaries?

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,078
They've got recruitment posters all over the men's bogs.
How come you've not seen them?

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,856
When I'm in the men's toilets in prison, Rimmer, I
tend not to look around, d'you know what I'm saying?

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,746
It's like playing golf. I
concentrate on me grip,

63
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,876
keep me eye on the ball, and
try not to veer off to the side.

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,310
The Canaries. Do you know what they say it's supposed to stand for?

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,678
"Convict Army Nearly All Retarded
Inbred Evil Sheepshaggers."

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,390
(LAUGHS) They haven't got an X-Chromosome
to share between them!

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,994
Smeg!

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,039
- It gets worse as well.
- Ha-ha! Worse? Go on.

69
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,759
I signed you up, too.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,234
I forged your signature.
I thought I was doing you a favour.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,315
- Me? Why?
- I've signed us all up.

72
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,835
- Kryten, Kris. Everyone.
- No way.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,674
No way. No way am I becoming a Canary.

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,869
It's a great honour for Floor 13,

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,797
for today we are visited by Captain Hollister,
who has a special assignment.

76
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,917
At last some action!

77
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,473
I've been going mental. All this time,
cooped up, not killing nothing. Yes!

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,597
Kill Crazy, shut up, you punk!

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,880
OK. Listen up.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,750
We've located a ship, the SSS Silverbird,
buried at the bottom of an ocean moon.

81
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,072
Remote probe has come back
with no signs of a crew.

82
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,596
No bodily remains, no skeletons - zip.

83
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,038
We want you guys to go onboard
and find out why.

84
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,679
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,720
# You are the sunshine of my life

86
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,439
# Ooh

87
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,116
# That's why I'll always be around #

88
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,679
Rimmer!

89
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,960
Sorry, sir. We appear to have wandered into the wrong
hobby group. We'll leave immediately. Go!

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,958
Rimmer! You're here and this is where you're staying. Now get on with it.

91
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,272
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. You heard what the warden said.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,273
He wants you to get on with it. From the top.

93
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,070
# You are the sunshine of my life... #

94
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,639
Rimmer!

95
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,997
Sorry, sir. When you said "get on with it" I thought you meant...

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,711
Shut up! You're a Canary, man! A member of the toughest
combat army this side of Pluto.

97
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,157
I've seen custard factories that
aren't as yellow as you are!

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,029
- Start behaving like a man.
- A man, sir.

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,635
Yes, of course, sir. A man.

100
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,077
A man? Perhaps if you could just remind me, sir
I'm sure it will all come back.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,834
(CRUNCHING)

102
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,471
Continue, Captain.

103
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,794
(RATTLING)

104
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,950
It's inconceivable a ship like this could have be sent out without a crew,

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,476
so whatever devoured the crew, bones and all,

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,039
might still be there,

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,111
so be careful.

108
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,476
Let's go kill something!

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,314
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!

110
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,079
I hope it's got like big teeth and claws
and like loads of heads. Yeah, great!

111
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,390
Here we go! At last! Yeah!

112
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
(CLANG)

113
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,032
OK. Stay together. Keep 'em peeled.

114
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
What's that?

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,828
What? Where?

116
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:04,435
It's moving, shaking from
side to side like a leaf.

117
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,910
I think that's your shadow, sir.

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,436
Located the mainframe.
Maybe it can tell us something.

119
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,355
Good evening, Arnold. I've been looking
forward to your arrival so very much.

120
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,911
- How do you know my name?
- My name is Cassandra.

121
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,550
I am a computer with the ability
to predict the future

122
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,314
with an accuracy rating of 100 per cent.

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,800
Bless you.

124
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,031
Bless you? What do you mean 'bless you'? No-

125
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,998
A-choo!

126
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,473
You need a tissue. Kris has one in her left hand pocket. She says,
"Would you like this?" You say, "Thanks."

127
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,870
- Would you like this?
- Thanks.

128
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,598
- "Extraordinary!"
- Extraordinary!

129
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,593
"The questions we can ask!
It can tell us our future."

130
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,479
The questions we can ask!
It can tell us our future.

131
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,758
"But, how does it work?
The future's not happened yet."

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,591
I wasn't going to say that.

133
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,227
I never said you would...

134
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:04,759
But how does it work?
The future's not happened yet.

135
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,157
..although you do.

136
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,197
Smeg!

137
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,630
Let's ask her a question about the future.
A biggie.

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,589
OK, Cassandra, do we ever get back to Earth?
Has the human race survived?

139
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,513
Do I ever find my singing tie pin?

140
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,280
Do we want to know all this stuff about the future?

141
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,353
Do we want to know for example, how and when we die?

142
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,436
Kris is right. Something like that could mess
your life up for ever. Cassandra, I have a question.

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,831
I know, Arnold because I know
the rest of this conversation.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,354
So what's the answer?

145
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,674
He chokes to death aged 181
trying to remove a bra with his teeth.

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,674
What was the question?

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,911
I just asked how you died.

148
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,799
You what? I didn't wanna know that!

149
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,713
- Whose bra?
- 181?

150
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,871
Probably your own.

151
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,752
Come on, though. Taking a bra off with me teeth
at 181, That's a hell of a sexy way to go!

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,031
So long as the teeth are in your mouth
at the time, sir.

153
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,993
I'm really screwed up now. I never wanted
to know that - know how I die.

154
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,152
It's completely spoilt the surprise!

155
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,598
Kryten, this is where you share your theory
with your crewmates.

156
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,913
I have a theory everyone. The Silverbird didn't crash,
did it, Cassandra?

157
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,551
The ship was sent here by the Space Corps
on autopilot to get rid of you -

158
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,156
to abandon you at the bottom
of a lunar sea in the depths of deep space.

159
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,233
That's brilliant, bud! How did you work that out?

160
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,597
I read it on this mission directive here.

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,551
So, there was no dead bodies on board
because the ship didn't have a crew.

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,030
A computer that unerringly predicts the future...

163
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,478
- ..is a dangerous thing indeed.
- is a dangerous... er... yes, precisely.

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,476
We, erm... should be making tracks.

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,793
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
The bulkhead's just given way

166
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,112
and we're shipping water
at 1000 gallons a second.

167
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,033
All the Canaries will be dead within one hour

168
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,157
- except for Rimmer...
- Yes!

169
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,470
..who will be dead in 20 minutes.

170
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,674
Only Lister, Kryten, the Cat
and Kochanski survive.

171
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,353
What happens to Rimmer?

172
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,071
He has a heart attack, brought on
by the stress of knowing he's going to die

173
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,158
and collapses during a conversation with me
in 19 minutes and 31 seconds.

174
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,358
I don't believe you. I simply don't believe you.

175
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,989
We shall see, or rather, YOU shall see.

176
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,390
I have already seen.

177
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,312
All the hairs on the back of my neck
are standing on end.

178
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,111
Mine, too, and not just the ones
on the back of my neck - it's one up, all up.

179
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,311
Well, it's not the first time we've been
in a situation like this, is it?

180
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,439
Hell, no. We've drunk coffee thousands of times.

181
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,079
We're veterans.

182
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,958
Future echoes, remember?

183
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,397
- Future echoes - all right!
- What was that?

184
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,350
We learned that if the future's already decided,
you can't change it.

185
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,912
Yeah, but what do you know?
You're a chicken-soup machine repairman,

186
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,515
not Hank Handsome, Space Adventurer.

187
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,750
Don't get ideas above your station,

188
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,309
and your station is Git Central.

189
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,952
Hey, I've been surviving in space five, six years.

190
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,637
When it comes to weirdy, paradoxy space stuff,
I bought the T-shirt.

191
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,194
He bought it and I ironed it for him.

192
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,236
- Exactly.
- So, you're saying the future's the future,

193
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,314
and, like your underpants,
the chances of change are remote.

194
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,278
Well, I'm sorry. I don't accept it.

195
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,354
- Hey, I'm not happy about it, man.
- None of us are.

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,150
You dying is the last thing we want, bud,
especially me.

197
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,029
Hell, I'll probably have to help dig the hole.

198
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,510
Right, so to summarise: six years of space adventuring,
six years of experience and knowledge

199
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,435
have led you to the conclusion
that I'm totally stuffed.

200
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,320
Mr Rimmer has a point, sir. Your greater
knowledge is making you pessimistic, while his

201
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:32,395
ignorance and almost doe-like naivety is keeping
his mind receptive to a possible solution.

202
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,517
Shut your stupid flat head, you.

203
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,354
So you're saying when you don't know enough
to know that you don't know enough,

204
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,993
there's no fear holding you back - you can achieve
things which people with more brains can't.

205
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,039
- Precisely.
- He's got the power of ignorance.

206
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,718
With the ignorance he's got, that makes him
one of the most powerful men that's ever lived.

207
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,475
Harness your stupidity, sir.
Employ your witlessness.

208
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,599
Use your empty-headed simplistic
moron mind and find a solution.

209
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,080
OK. I've got an idea.

210
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,153
Kryten, replay our meeting with Cassandra in your CPU,

211
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,836
and tell me if at any point,
anyone ever called me Rimmer.

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,391
- What?
- (BEEPING)

213
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,461
At no point throughout the meeting
did anyone refer to you as Rimmer.

214
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:22,070
In fact, we barely looked at you.

215
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,759
That's just what I thought.

216
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,278
Cassandra said, "Rimmer dies," but it doesn't
necessarily follow that that means me.

217
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,752
- Who does it mean, then, your dad?
- Look, Cassandra doesn't know the future.

218
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,399
She sees pictures of it.

219
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,997
She could have seen another guy die of a heart
attack. Someone she's been told is *called* Rimmer.

220
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,390
- He's right.
- All I've got to do

221
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,713
is to find someone I can
introduce to Cassandra as Rimmer,

222
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,032
and it will be them that stiffs out and not me.

223
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,194
Such lowlife conniving -
it's impossible not to be impressed!

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,709
What I wouldn't give
to have your weasel gene, sir!

225
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,036
- Now, wait a minute.
- Oh, look, here's Mr Knot.

226
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,151
- You made this area secure?
- Yes, sir. Mr Knot, sir. Coffee, sir?

227
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,359
I've been asked by the Captain to inspect a mainframe. Where is it?

228
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,911
Agh! You idiot!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

229
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,434
Please...

230
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,114
Have my jacket. I insist.

231
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,590
Then I shall lead you to Cassandra.
There we are, sir.

232
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,751
A perfect fit, sir.

233
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,595
- Lead the way, Rimmer.
- Don't call me Rimmer!

234
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,116
- That's your name.
- Yes, But 'Rimmer'... its so full of nobility

235
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,910
and quiet courage.
Call me Arsewipe or Fishbreath.

236
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,791
Not Rimmer, sir. Never Rimmer, sir.

237
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,749
OK, Arsewipe, whatever you say.
Now, where's the mainframe?

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,310
Hello, Arnold. Bang on time.

239
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,313
I've brought you a visitor, Cassandra. Do you know his name?

240
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,869
- Yes, I do... Not..
- What?

241
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,360
- Not.
- Knot?

242
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,833
Let me finish. Not that it matters what his
name is. I mean, our relationship doesn't last very long.

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,198
- I understand you have the ability to predict...
- ..the future, yes.

244
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,590
- 100 per cent reli...
- ..able, yes.

245
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,428
What happens to me?
Do I get back to earth?

246
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:25,356
No, you die in about four seconds time of a heart attack
after hearing the news that you're going to die of a heart attack.

247
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,269
You filthy... (GROANS)

248
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,199
- Poor Rimmer.
- Yes, poor old Rimmer.

249
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,716
- My name is Knot...
- Your name is not what?

250
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,235
Knot! Knot! Knot!

251
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,434
- Is he dead now?
- I'm afraid so.

252
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,637
Yes!

253
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,077
He died of a massive coronary,
just as I prophesied.

254
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,560
Yes!

255
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,953
You seem inordinately happy, Arnold, but why?
You're going to die, too.

256
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,952
But you said... I've just...
I'm going to die, too?

257
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,336
I already told you. Rimmer dies of a heart attack
and then you and all the other Canaries die, too.

258
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,319
All except Lister, Kryten,
Kochanski and the Cat. I've seen it.

259
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,030
That's as well as maybe,
but you have you seen this?

260
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,999
Yes, I'm afraid I have.

261
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,659
You were right, there's nothing I can do.

262
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:35,630
According to Cassandra, our
future is decided and we four survive.

263
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,271
Therefore, while we are here,
we cannot die. Regard.

264
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,471
(GUN DOESN'T FIRE)

265
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,278
Duck, sir.

266
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,352
(BULLET RICOCHETS)

267
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,840
Duck again, sir!

268
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,153
As I thought.

269
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,029
So, in other words, if I...

270
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,791
- What's that for?
- You can't die.

271
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,157
Yeah, but I can still feel pain, you smegger!

272
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,799
So how about this? We use
our powers of invulnerability,

273
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:16,951
which will last until we return to Red Dwarf,

274
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:20,634
and surround Mr Rimmer, escort him up
to the obs deck and into the diving bell?

275
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,954
(LISTER) The diving bell. We've made it.

276
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,191
Where did he go?

277
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,920
Yo!

278
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,471
(RUSHING WATER)

279
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,758
- Hear that?
- Water.

280
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
- Kris, take cover. The water's coming!
- Quick, The diving bell!

281
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,834
Great! Everything above us is flooded

282
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,039
and now we're back down
in the bowels again with Cassandra.

283
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,111
It's coming true.

284
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,318
My death! It's all coming true.

285
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,398
You tried to cheat the future and failed,
as I knew you would.

286
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,518
So what happens now? How...?

287
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,159
How do I die?

288
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,119
Lister catches you making love to Kochanski

289
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,717
and shoots you through the head
with a harpoon gun.

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,753
Can you just double-check that?

291
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,800
I've seen it. It's what happens -
in the old laundry room.

292
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,032
So let me just repeat what I think you're saying.

293
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,157
Arnold - that's me -

294
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,599
and Kochanski - that's the woman,
the really attractive one you saw earlier -

295
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,434
me and her are in bed giving it rizz...

296
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,999
when Lister - that's the short, dumpy one
with the stupid haircut -

297
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,949
walks in and shoots me through the head
while I'm making love with Kochanski?

298
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,270
That is what is going to happen.

299
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,478
Fantastic!

300
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,796
- I can't believe what you're telling me.
- I can scarcely believe it myself.

301
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,158
I mean, obviously you're incredibly attractive, I never thought you'd look at me twice.

302
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,994
Neither did I!

303
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,915
But, apparently, we're gonna make love.
Unbe-smegging-lievable or what?

304
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,789
- It's not warm in here. Fancy a wee nip?
- No, no no no...

305
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,391
But why would I want to sleep with you?
I mean it doesn't make sense.

306
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,471
Maybe you get blind-drunk.

307
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,837
That doesn't excuse my other four senses.

308
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,551
Right. Barely an hour to go.
Shall we get started?

309
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,839
I mean, let's face it,
you can't change the future - sadly.

310
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,439
But you said you could.

311
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,194
Yeah, I've changed my mind now.

312
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,639
Look, are you sure you wouldn't
prefer to play the opera game instead?

313
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,316
Kris, it's what Cassandra saw.
You can't cheat fate.

314
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,635
Well, just watch me. Because there is no way on earth that I'm climbing
out of my clothes and clambering into that bed.

315
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,919
My clothes are soaking!

316
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,038
Why don't you take them off and dry them on the heater.

317
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,040
It's coming true. It's all coming true.

318
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,033
It's coming true. It's all coming true!

319
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,759
(GROANS)

320
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,631
Bud, you can't go back there.

321
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,791
Cassandra said Kris survives,

322
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,477
and the only way that's gonna happen
is if someone goes back in and saves her.

323
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,870
Chuck us that harpoon gun, will ya?

324
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,756
(SINGS CHEERFULLY)

325
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,430
# Ba-la-bup-doodle-up-bap! #

326
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,791
I'm not sure about this. This is the first time
I've ever seduced by predeterminism theory.

327
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,678
One hour exactly.

328
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,350
Oh, bloody buggering hell!

329
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,351
Tonight must be the night
they put the clocks forward!

330
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,879
I've got it.

331
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,031
That's more than I did.

332
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,314
I've worked it all out.

333
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,475
I never get any breaks ever!
20 seconds later, you could have been on top

334
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,553
and I could have used you as a human shield.

335
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,396
I must have been mad. What the hell
was I thinking? I felt sorry for you.

336
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,713
- Look, will you shut up and listen to me.
- No, why aren't you mad that I'm in bed with him?

337
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,315
'Cause I know WHY you're in bed with him!

338
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,838
- I also know that I don't kill him.
- Oh, but Cassandra promised.

339
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,831
Cassandra made that up
to force you two together,

340
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,356
so that you'd feel sorry for him and
hopefully end up sleeping with him.

341
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,797
- So, why did she say she saw it happen?
- To try and make it happen.

342
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,031
- But why?
- To try and punish me.

343
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,418
Punish you? Why?

344
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:30,120
'Cause Cassandra knows and has
always known how she dies.

345
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,194
She's trying to make me suffer now for something I'm destined to do in the future.

346
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,480
You kill her, don't you?

347
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,553
That's why she hates you because she
knows you're going to kill her.

348
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,237
That's what this whole thing was about.

349
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,913
Kryten figured it out.

350
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,916
Kryten figured it out, did he? Good old Kryten (!)

351
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,915
But did he really have to figure it out
quite so damn fast?

352
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,118
Would it have killed him to take
30 minutes longer? Ten minutes even?

353
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,791
Two would have done.

354
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,229
I'm gonna take care of the rest of it now.

355
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,597
I'll erm... see you two lovebirds later.

356
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,197
Look... Thanks for being with me tonight.

357
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,718
I can't think of anyone I'd rather share
my final hour with than you.

358
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,030
I really mean that.

359
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,597
I'm not all bad. In fact, sometimes,
I'm quite sweet and sensitive.

360
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,751
Bye.

361
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,319
By the way...

362
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,031
Is it OK if I keep these?

363
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,993
If the future's all worked out - horoscopes, all that
stuff - it means we're not responsible for anything we do.

364
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,154
It means we're just actors saying lines in a
script that's been written by somebody else.

365
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,077
I don't want to believe that. I want to believe
I'm in charge of me own life. Me own destiny.

366
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,996
So I'm not gonna kill you, Cassandra.
I'm out of here.

367
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,674
But you DO kill me. I've seen it.

368
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,869
Tomorrow's a new day - a fresh page
in a book that's not been written yet.

369
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,429
What happens in the future is up to me,

370
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,513
not some predetermined-destiny smeg.

371
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,512
I'll see you, kidder.

372
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,632
Smeg.

373
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,350
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

374
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,751
# I'm all alone, more or less

375
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,072
# Let me fly far away from here

376
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,039
# Fun, fun, fun

377
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,636
# In the sun, sun, sun

378
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,156
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

379
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,358
# Drinking fresh mango juice

380
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,876
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

381
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,634
# Fun, fun, fun

382
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,475
# In the sun, sun, sun

383
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,234
# Fun, fun, fun

384
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,473
# In the sun, sun, sun #
