(ON MONITOR) I am seeking
JMC Second Technician

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
Arnold Judas Rimmer.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
Keep it zipped. Say nothing.
Sound-wise, we're going commando people.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,960
That's him there!

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,400
I cracked. Sorry, guys!

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,560
I tried to stay strong, but he broke me!

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,840
Second Technician Rimmer,

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,480
I understand you have a crew man
who falls under your jurisdiction.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,520
A 'David Lister'.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
Right there, bud!

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
Sorry, guys, he...
He broke me again!

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,200
What do you expect?
I'm not made of concrete!

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,560
I am Combat Droid Four of Batch 27.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,240
We wish to conduct a transaction
of goods with you.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,480
But you're simulants.
You despise humans.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,720
Why would you wanna trade with us?

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,760
You have something we want
and we have something you want.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,160
-What?
-A hostage

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,720
taken from human transport ship.

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,920
Allow me to show you.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,480
We cannot negotiate with simulants.

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,920
We cannot cave in
to their insane demands.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Under no circumstances are JMC personnel
permitted to negotiate with the enemy.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Guys, it's me! They've taken me hostage.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,800
You've gotta help me!
Argh!

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,160
Of course, that's what the JMC think,

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,120
but who the hell listens
to those pen pushers?

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Here are our demands.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
One second. We need a moment.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
(BEEPING)

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,680
What's going on here?

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,800
Is that me? How can it be me, I'm here?

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,880
There are a number of options, sir.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,120
All involving you and all extremely bad.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm all ears!

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,920
Perhaps that person we saw
is a different version

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,200
of Mr Rimmer
from an alternative dimension.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,280
So, if he dies,
not the end of the world?

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,880
Or perhaps he's a clone of Mr Rimmer

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,000
produced somehow from his DNA.

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Again, if he dies,
not the end of the world.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,320
Or perhaps that man is you, sir,

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,880
a you seized from the future
and taken back into the past.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Again, if he dies,
not the end of the world.

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,840
We've no choice,
we're gonna have to negotiate.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,640
- But we never negotiate with the enemy.
- Until today.

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,080
Well, if that's the way they're gonna
roll, let me handle negotiations.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,280
You think I'm gonna leave the life
of a possible future me in your hands?

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
I've seen movies, Rimmer.
I know how to talk to hostage takers.

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,520
I've done
JMC crisis negotiation, Lister.

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm handling this.
Now, get me a pad and open comms.

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
Okay, Arn, we're working on the pad.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,280
But in return, I'm gonna need
something from you.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,920
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,480
Are you just using your hostage
negotiation techniques on me?

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
Just get me a damn pad!

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Okay, Arnold, we're working on the pad,
but you gotta realise

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,040
I can't pull a pad
out my ass in five minutes.

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
I've gotta talk to my boss.
They've gotta talk to their boss.

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
They've gotta talk to the DA.

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,680
Here are my demands.

71
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
In return for the whiny
human hologram man,

72
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,200
you will give us the Casket of Cronos,

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
which you salvaged from our abandoned
attack ship the AS Thanatos.

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,160
The Casket of what? What's that?

75
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,040
It contains the essence of 23 of 27.

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
I remember this.

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,040
It's upstairs in the rec room
underneath the pool table.

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,880
-For safe keeping?
-Nah, to keep the table level.

79
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,120
Go and get it!

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh, man!

81
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,160
Now the pool table's gonna be
all bent and wibbly again!

82
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
How do we know you won't betray us?

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,160
I am 4 of 27.
I am a warrior and high born.

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520
Who do you think I am? Three of 63?

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Three of 63? You're nothing like him.

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,880
Then, we trade.

I'm back! Thank god!

94
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,000
I was their hostage. I didn't think
you were ever gonna save me.

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
I was kinda hoping we weren't!

96
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,320
You were only gone two seconds.

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Two seconds for you,
but for me it was hours.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,400
I overheard what they were saying.

99
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,840
That Cronos casket didn't contain
the spirit of anyone.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,080
It was an amplifier they needed
to plug into their temporal transporter

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,320
to expand the beam.

102
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,160
-What?
-They're Expanoids.

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
What the hell are Expanoids?

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Droids capable of doubling
their transistor power every two years.

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,040
They progress so rapidly,

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,800
they became threat
to every living entity in the universe.

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
What are they planning?

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,280
To travel back into the past
to change the present.

109
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
That's a bit old hat, isn't it?

110
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,520
How many times have we seen that before?

111
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,200
Expanoids are unemotional,
cold-hearted psychopaths.

112
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,240
They will have no hesitation

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,800
using hackneyed old clichés
if it suits their purpose.

114
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,440
If they've gone back into the past
to screw around with human evolution,

115
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,960
how come I'm still here?

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,800

120

We need to get after them,
stop whatever they're doing

121
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,680
and get that Cronos machine back.

122
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,400
So, we can utilise
its time travel abilities ourselves?

123
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,120
No, so we can prop
the pool table back up.

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,200
We've gotta find them
and get that Cronos machine!

176

(BEEPING)

177
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,360
Well, the vibrations in the lithosphere
tells us there's some kind of township

178
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,120
not far from here.

179
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,720
CAT: Are we there yet?
KRYTEN: Not far now, sirs.

180
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,520
Real people?

181
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,680
I'm gonna be seeing real people again.

182
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,360
Gas street lighting. Steam-powered
right-hand drive motor vehicles.

183
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,040
Technology-wise this time period doesn't
correlate with anything in my database.

184
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,360
Any theories, Kryts?

185
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Mmm, not at this juncture, sir.

186
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,320
Why do you always ask him
if he's got any theories?

187
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,440
I'm acting stand-in, commanding,
senior, premier officer.

188
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,000
Why do you never ask me?

189
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,240
Maybe I've got a theory?

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,880
Maybe I've got a really great theory.

191
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,880
But you're always too busy asking him

192
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,120
to find out how great
my theory really is.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
-Okay, any theories, Rimmer?
-No!

194
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,480
-It's the principle.
-Look at that.

195
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,720
(READING) "Closed for violation
of the Prohibition Act."

196
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,000
Prohibition, that was the 1920s.

197
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,320
Yeah, when alcohol was banned
and the bootleggers took over.

198
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Dark days.

199
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,400
Society run by a bunch of hoodlum
gangsters, dark days indeed.

200
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,280
I was thinking more about the booze ban.

201
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
Whatever they prohibited
around here, it ain't booze.

202
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,040
Look at that!

203
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, if it's not booze they prohibited,
what is it?

204
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,000
According to this leaflet,
the year is 1952,

205
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,080
nearly two decades
after prohibition ended.

WOMAN: Hey, don't move.

208
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,560
Well, lookie here, illegal contraband.

209
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,720
If that's the penalty for toast,
what the hell do you get for pizza?

210
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,560
It's not the toast that's illegal, sir.
It's the technology.

211
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,520
That's why that electron wavelet
shut down Starbug.

212
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,880
Any technology beyond the 1920s
is illegal 'round here.

213

Unless, of course, you're an Expanoid.

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,720
The Expanoid's haven't travelled
into the past to change the present.

215
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,080
They travelled into the past
to enslave humanity.

216
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,000
-It's contraband.
-By doing what?

217
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,840
By travelling to a point in history
where we haven't got the technology

218
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,680
to defeat them or defend ourselves.

219
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
And they plan for it to stay that way.
Hence the tech ban.

220
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,080
A tech ban which means
you, sir, are illegal.

221
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,480
He is?

222
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,440
I may move here.
Lay down roots and start a family.

223
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
He's not the only one who's illegal.
So am I!

224
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,880

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Einstein, Hubble and Edison.

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,600
But you only get phonus ballonus
out of those screwballs.

347
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,920
They're spifflacated
morning, noon and night.

348
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,120
Did you say Einstein,
as in Albert Einstein?

349
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,920
Sure. He's half goofy now,
screaming at people who aren't there.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,760
Walking around the park
pushing a pram full of string.

351
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
He's got some theory about it,
but no one will listen.

352
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,280
Pram theory?

353
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,640
Einstein's one of the most brilliant
minds that ever lived.

354
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
He can do anything.

355
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,800
You think I'm just off the boat?

356
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,120
Well, where will we find him?

357
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,160
At this time? Probably on the corner
of Hope Street with the other blueys.

358
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,440
Hey, man, is that your pram?

359
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
Yes!

360
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,400
Sir, allow me to introduce myself.

361
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,560
Who the hell are you?

362
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Acting senior officer Arnold Rimmer
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

363
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,960
I have to say, at school,
I always loved a bit of science.

364
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,120
Bunsen burners, brilliant.
Dropping sodium into water.

365
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,880
All the fizzing. Marvellous.

366
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,200
Oh, and congratulations on...
What was it again?

367
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,440
The theory of relativity, sir.

368
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
The theory of relativity.

369
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,320
I don't know what you're talking about?

370
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Of course, of course!

371
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,360
In this world,
he hasn't achieved anything.

372
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,840
So, how can he help us?

373
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,440
He'll still be a genius.

374
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,680
Whatever problem we give him,
he'll be able to solve.

375
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,680
Come on, let's get Einey the Winey back
to the Lady Be Good.

376
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,000
It's my pram. My pram.

377
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
You leave the string alone, yes?

378
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
Don't take my string.

379
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,040
You leave my string alone you see?

380
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,640
Your string is fine, sir.
Your string is safe.

381
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,640
-My string.
-We won't touch your string.

382
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,200
-My string.
-It's your string.

383
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,800
Would you mind getting him a steak
with spring fries or something?

384
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,840
Now, here's the problem,
we've gotta get this into this somehow.

385
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
How?

386
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,400
You think I know?

387
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,520
I don't know.

388
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,760
Yes, you do, and do you know why?

389
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,400
Because you're genius. You can do this!

390
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,320
-I can do this?
-We realise electrics

391
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,360
isn't strictly Einstein's field,

392
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
but we thought he was
so incredibly brilliant,

393
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,800
he'd be able to figure it out.

394
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,120
You ain't gonna get nothing
outta this gutter muncher.

395
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,480
Oh, and why not?

396
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,320
'Cause this bird ain't Einstein!

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,840
What, he's just some old bum
who pushes around a pram full of string?

398
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
You got it.

399
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,880
We haven't been introduced.
I am Bob the Bum.

400
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,320
So, you want to know if I can get
this potato into this potato?

401
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,320
I'll get right onto it.

402
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,720
I didn't realise I was so brilliant!

403
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,480
Cops, coming down the alley!

404
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
It's a raid!

405
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,080
(PLAYING JAZZ)

406
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,680
Find something to do!
Don't look suspicious.

407
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,400
It doesn't go there, how about there?

408
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,720
(WHISPERS) I can do this, I'm brilliant!

409
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
-Okay, everybody pipe down! Quiet!
-(MUSIC STOPS)

410
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,400
This is a raid.

411
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
Hey, drinking and dancing ain't illegal.
What's the beef?

412
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
Harmony De Gaultier.

413
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,680
Now that's one fancy stage name,

414
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
but you ain't fooling no one,
Professor Baldwin!

415
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,760
That's who you are, ain't it?

416
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,040
A dirty, no-good scientist
who'll discuss

417
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,080
theoretical physics with anyone
so long as the funding's right.

418
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm outta the science game now, see?

419
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,640
I ain't touched a petri dish in months.

420
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,200
How dense do you think I am?

421
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,760
You really wanna know?
Just divide your mass by your volume.

422
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,400
Hey. What the hell happened
to your face?

423
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,520
Who me? I went bobbing for apples
in the cement mixer.

424
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,200
Sure ya did.

425
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
So what do you do?

426
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,920
I just play in the band, ma'am.

427
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,640
Ooh, and what about you?

428
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,760
(CHUCKLES) Are you a scientist?

429
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,000
(TAP DANCING)

430
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
You think scientist could
tap dance like that? Hmm?

431
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,840
Wait a minute.

432
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
How come you're drinking out
of an Erlenmeyer flask?

433
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,080
They've been doing science!
You're busted!

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,960
We nailed a couple of white-coats, boss.

435
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
We think they know something
about this screwy contraption machine

436
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,880
the resistance bunnies have
been working on to whack you guys.

437
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,080
So, we meet again.

438
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,800
(CHUCKLES) You really don't mind
a hackneyed old cliché, do ya?

439
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,360
You know, we're
really not so different, you and I.

440
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
Now you're taking the smeg.

441
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,560
What is it you want?

442
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Human beings in the distant future

443
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,200
realised that humanity was
not mature enough

444
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,000
to handle modern technology.

445
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,280
And so, we were created
to prevent that version of the future

446
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,160
from ever happening.

447
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
We are the good guys here.

448
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,640
But you kill people!

449
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,120
No one said that we couldn't have
a little fun along the way.

450
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,400
So what happens to us?
Are you gonna kill us too?

451
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,120
I wasn't planning to, but, you know,
that's a really good idea.

452
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,000
You're gonna kill us in cold blood?

453
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,360
Actually, human blood isn't cold.
It's around 37.5 degrees centigrade.

454
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,840
Prepare to die, human scum.

455
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,760
You said you were a high born!
A droid of distinction.

456
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,240
A real big spender!

457
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,520
So much better than that other droid,
what was his name?

458
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
Three of 63.

459
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,560
Did someone say my name?

460
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,000
Ah, so you're of Three of 63?

461
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,600
- What of it?
- Nothing. Er, don't say anything.

462
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,040
We're good now.

463
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,760
He was slagging you off
behind your back.

464
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,240
- He was?
- Look, just leave it, Three of 63.

465
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,960
It's not worth it.

466
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,520
No, no. You were slagging me off
behind my back.

467
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,680
Look, you remember we were
going through that bad patch?

468
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Well...

469
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,320
You're no better than 18 of 241.

470
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,040
Ooh!

471
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,920
- Two potato makes one potato!
- (POWERING UP)

472

(FIRING)

473
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
- You did it!
- Bob!

474
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,680
You are brilliant!

475
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,840
Just like you said!

476
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,640
We don't have much time.

477
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,760
This place will be swarming
with Expanoids in no time.

478
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
If I can hook this to the transmitter,

479
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,040
we can send the signal worldwide
and wipe out all the mechs.

480
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about Kryten?

481
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,040
We have to detonate it,
there's no choice.

482
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
- No!
- Lister, don't you see?

483
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,360
Once the Expanoids are gone,
you can stay here.

484
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,160
We'll no longer be trapped together.

485
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,600
I can't lose Kryten.

486
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,400
Listen to me, sir, Mr Rimmer is speaking
only about what is best for you.

487
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,800
As obviously detonating a global
EMP will destroy him too.

488
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,080
Hang on, it's gonna take me out too?

489
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,360
Anything electrical.

490
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
My hair straighteners?

491
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,680
Hand over the EMP.

492
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,360
I already detonated it
while you two were yacking.

493
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
You got 15 minutes to scram!

494
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
Leg it!

495
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,040
We're five minutes to orbit!

496
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,440
Activating the Cronos machine.

497
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,080
Sir, we're gonna hit
some turb at 37,000 feet.

498
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,720
Any chance we can go a shorter route?

499
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Not according to Pythagoras.

500
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,920
Yeah, well, Pythagoras wasn't
much of a pilot.

501
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
- Leave this to me.
- (WHOOSHING)

502
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,440
I learned a few things today, Kryten.

503
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
Hmm, really sir? What about?

504
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,440
Well, it seems to me
us humans better be on our toes.

505
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,280
Make sure we don't lose ourselves
and let technology take over.

506
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,800
Mmm, I'll make a note, sir,
and remind you

507
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,400
if you ever appear
to be in danger. Arms?

508
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,560
Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

Other socky.

513
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,520
You can't rely on machines, Kryten,

514
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
or else we'll lose
the very thing that makes us human.

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,840
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

520
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,080
# We're all alone
More or less

521
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,520
# Let me fly
Far away from here

522
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,080
# Fun, fun, fun
In the sun, sun, sun

00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,520
# I want to lie
Shipwrecked and comatose

# Drinking fresh mango juice

525
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,200
# Gold fish shoals nibbling at my toes

526
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,720
# Fun, fun, fun
In the sun, sun, sun

527
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,680
# Fun, fun, fun
In the sun, sun, sun #
