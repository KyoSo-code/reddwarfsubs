- Huh?
- Who's Inga?

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,320
Oh, just someone I met at a party
thrown by a giraffe called Gerald.

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
She wanted me to fly with her to Paris,

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,600
but she had a wooden head
and was afraid of forks.

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,800
There's no future in it.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,600
According to Freud's
lexicon of dream symbols,

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,280
flying is supposed to be
a metaphor for sex.

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,320
Absolute poppycock,
I dream of flying all the time.

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,640
It's certainly nothing to do with sex.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,240
It's always the same dream.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm in a Boeing 727
and it can't take off.

I'm sitting there with
a tiny bag of nuts I can't get open,

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,600
then, suddenly, after one giant tug,
and much to my embarrassment,

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
the whole bag explodes
over premium economy.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,920
Now tell me, because I don't see it,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,960
how on earth is that
anything to do with sex?

Ah, best guess,
the Nautilus is bio-printing its crew,

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,080
which was fashionable
in the 24th century

54

were sent into space

a point of interest, need or danger

for the mission

Human-like, they're created
from synthetic stem cells,

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
but like many movie stars,

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,680
they'll be incapable of
having children in the normal way.

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440

your engines are burnt out

Sirs, intel coming in,
it's much as I feared.

The nearer the Nautilus gets to us,
the more we, ourselves, are in danger.

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
How do you make that one out?

98

If the Nautilus is destroyed
in its present position we're safe,

99

but when the Nautilus enters
the asteroid storm...

that's what I've done,

106

it was the only option.

Herring what you've done.

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,320
What, tell him I've just nuked his ship,
I'm not telling him that.

- He won't like me.

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,760

Me, sir, Arnold J Rimmer.

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
You mean you took off my wing,

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,320
knowing it would knock me out
of the asteroid storm?

118
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,040
That's genius, Rimmer.

119
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,920
They don't call me
Old Iron Balls for nothing, sir.

120

124
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm promoting you to Officer, Rimmer.

125
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,480
I'll send the authorisation through now.
I look forward to meeting you.

as an officer.

no more than an hour,

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
and then I'll outline my plans
to open a new Officers Club on D deck.

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600

away from the grind of command.

147
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,560
Oh, so, basically, sir,

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
One question, sir.

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
The fact that you've been
awarded officer-hood

151
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
by an act of gross deception,

152
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,040
does that in any way
take the sheen off it?

153
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
Not really, no.

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,880
It's about getting there, Kryten,
not how you get there.

in her apartment last night,

156
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Gosh.

172
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,880
It's not too bad. Hot dog?

173
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
Attention, attention,
Officer Rimmer here.

174
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,040
We'll shortly be approaching SS Nautilus
to welcome Captain Herring.

175
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,040
Would all lower orders
please make their way to B deck?

176
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,920
What the smeg's this?

177
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Why is the old service lift
been turned into the grunts Lift?

178
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,080
So the rank and file can travel
between floors with their own kind.

179
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,080
Meantime, you use the officer's lift,

180
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,520
which we can't use on account
of the fact that we're not "officery".

181
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,680
It's one of the privileges of rank,

- Ah, thank you.

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
KRYTEN: Facial mist for you, sir.

187
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,200
Lovely.

for you, sir.

189
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,960
Most kind.

194
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,880
Floor? I said floor.

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,200
- Landing bay, please.
- What?

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,360
Landing bay.

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay, keep your hair on.
I'm not deaf. am I?

198
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,120
Has he interfered with the lift somehow,
made it ruder?

199
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,480

Have a wonderful onward journey

200
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,160
and we look forward to going down
with you again soon.

201
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
Ah, enchanting.

202
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,400
Oh, how hot was that Lift?
My diodes are almost cooked.

203
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,040
And look at my hair,
I've lost volume, height, bounce.

204
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,160
No way am I putting up with this.

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,280
"Officer's Corridor"? What's this?

208
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,520
He's had the skutters refurb
the old tube tunnel.

209
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
See you at the end of the corridor.
Bon voyage.

210

of everything, air con, music.

Welcome aboard, Captain Herring.

214
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,000
That's a hell of a ceiling
you've got, Rimmer.

215
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,760
The latticework's stunning.

216
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,880
You're most kind, sir.

217
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,120
Not massively important,
but this is our crew.

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
- Cat.

- Kryten.
- Uh-huh.

220
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,160
And Third Technician Lister.

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,000
Ah, is this Lister?

222
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,720
(CHUCKLES) I can tell he's no good
just by feeling him.

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm on to you, Lister,
don't think I'm not.

224
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,880
Which reminds me, Rimmer,

225
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,120
I might've been a bit hasty
promoting you to officer.

226
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,120
I should've promoted you
to First Lieutenant and now I have.

227
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,360
Congratulations.

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,720
Thank you so much, sir.

230
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,200
What's the situation with
the Nautilus, Flight Lieutenant?

231
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,160
Oh, that's me. The skutters
are unloading your cargo, sir.

232
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,280
The ship's done for, I'm afraid.

233
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,400
Well, the cargo's safe, at least,
that means my mission's up.

234
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,480
How are we gonna get him demoted now?

235
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640
How indeed?

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,200
MMmm.

237
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,840
Yes, elegant, stylish.

238
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,000
This'll suit me and my fellow officers
down to the ground, Kryten.

239
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,480
How are you coming along
with the bio-printer?

240
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,960
- Ah, I've repaired it, sir.
- So soon? How?

241
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I gave it a good kicking.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,200
I thought you didn't believe
in hitting machines.

243
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,120
Oh, photocopiers and printers
are an exception, sir.

244
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,560
We're just waiting for it to calibrate.

245
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,760
Good and then we can start to bio-print
the Nautilus' crew?

246
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,440
- Indeed.
- Excellent.

247
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,160
I want to print out all those
who ranked below me,

248
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
regardless of job or profession.

249
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
Shouldn't we speak to Mr Lister, sir?

250
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,000
Kryten, bio-printing
is an officer-only privilege.

251
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,720
Decisions of this magnitude
can't be left to a lowly technician.

252
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,320
Sir, are you familiar with
the Abraham Lincoln quotation on power?

253
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
Lincoln, the President?

254
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,440
- He got assassinated at the theatre.
- Indeed.

255
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,720
I've never been a fan
of the theatre, Kryten.

256
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,920
My mother used to take me,
and some of the most excruciating hours

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,760
of my life have been spent there.

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,520
Sometimes, the greater tragedy is going
to the theatre and not getting shot.

259
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
You were saying?

260
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,280
Lincoln once said, "If you want to test
a man's character, give him power."

261
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,880
And Officer Rimmer once said,

262
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,400
"If you want to feel my boot up
your recharge socket, keep talking."

263
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,400
So we can print out any of these people?

264
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,520
Yeah.

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,560
What about her?

266
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,640
A fitness ball lady
in tight Lycra shorts?

267
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,640
She can't demote anybody.

268
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,960
So what if she can't?
I can see past that.

269
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,960
Sirs.

270
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,720
No, wait, wait, wait, wait,
go back, go back, go back.

271
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
That's you.

272
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
That's me. How's that me?

273
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,960
Your genome was
in the Nautilus' database?

274
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,520
What? How?

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
Ah.

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,080
Ah.

277
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Ah...

278
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,520
I think I might've flogged it.

279
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,120
You flogged your genome?

280
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
Yeah, I was a kid and my mate, Dodgy,
offered me $£100

281
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
and half a packet of fags for it.

282
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,280
All I had to do was
put some saliva on a stick.

283
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,160
You sold the rights to your unique
haploid set of chromosomes, sir?

284
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,080
You traded away the map categorising
every detail of your genetic make-up

285
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,040
for $£100
and half a packet of fags?

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,320
You think he should've held out
for a whole pack?

287
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,800
Sir, this means someone else holds
the copyright to you.

288
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,360
You don't own yourself.

289
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,880
What? Like every time I take a leak
I'm handling stolen goods?

290
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,880
Look, we're three millions years
into the big black.

291
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,800
No one's coming out here. Who cares?

292
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,120
- Exactly. We're cool.
- Cool.

293
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,160
Sir, I don't think you appreciate
what you've done.

294
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,920
Thousands of different companies have
taken out a licence to produce yous.

295
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,640
You're like writing software
that people can buy

296
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,200
and then use as they like.

297
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,560
- What and do what they want with?
- Mmm, here's one.

298
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,840

to be used in call centres.

300
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Do you mean all those smart-arse
Scousers in call centres are me?

301
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,320
I've had those Johnnys,
they're a pain in the backside.

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,080
They know nothing and they sound like
they don't wanna be there.

303
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,240
They don't, sir, they're you.

304
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,880
What have you done, bud?

305
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,920
So Rimmer is gonna use this machine
to produce people who will obey him.

306
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,480
Never being born has gotta be better
than a life like that.

307
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,800
We've gotta wipe the database, Kryten.
Delete it all right now.

308
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,120
I can't, sir, I have to print out
a new crew as instructed.

309
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,720
Now Mr Rimmer's a Flight Lieutenant,
I can't refuse his orders.

310
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Well, I'll do it,
just tell me what to do.

311
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,640
Sir, if you think I am going
to select all these files,

312
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,680
and then take my leave, taking my leave,

313
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,560
so you can press that button there,
you've got another thing coming.

314
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,000
The entire database has deleted itself?

315
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,920
Check bio-printer, this is
going down in my daily to-do list.

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,720
- How?
- It's a mystery, sir.

317
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,720
I bet Lister's behind this.

318
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Isn't it possible to print anyone?
I need a crew to command.

319
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,280
Well, in theory it is possible
to insert a piece of DNA

320
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
into the bio-printer
and have it produce a genome.

321
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,640
But who would we print?

322
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,400
My mind's on file in the holo-suite
and my DNA's on all my old belongings.

323
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,560
With the remaining bio-ink
we could produce 50 versions of me,

324
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,000
make them all officers
so as Flight Lieutenant, I am over them,

325
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,600
and then we can have Officers Club
crammed full of Rimmers.

326
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,760
Sir, history tells us that you and you
is a very bad mix.

327
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,440
You and 50 yous is beyond horrific.

328
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,360
Not if I'm their Commanding Officer,
then they'll do what I want.

329
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,040
Move the bio-printer to one
of the junk rooms and double security.

330
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,960
Things are about to get
a whole lot more Rimmery.

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,040
- Where'd they come from?
- He's bio-printing Rimmers.

335
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,920
We gotta kill that damn machine
before he prints any more.
