LISTER: Ow!

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,920
Ah!

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,520
Ow!

5
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,280
Lister, it's 6:00 in the morning.

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,600
What are you doing?

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm just trimming my big toe
with these lawn hedge trimmers.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,920
So, you've finished Kierkegaard's
The Concept of Irony, then?

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,560
I've got an ingrown toenail, Rimmer.
It's killing me, man!

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,880
Thank it for me.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,400
I've tried everything.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,280
Scissors, nailfile.

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,360
Why don't you get Kryten
to do it for you?

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,680
Have you seen the size of his hands?

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,360
They're like space shovels.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,760
It'd be like asking Herman Munster
for a circumcision.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,040
- No, thanks!

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,560
- Speaking of...
- Breakfast, sir.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,920
Kryten, it's 6:00 in the morning!

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,240
We moved the clocks forward today, sir.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,400
And remember last year when it was time
to move the clocks forward

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,280
and you wanted another hour in bed?

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
So you asked if I could move the clocks

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
forward an extra hour
the following year instead?

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,200
Well, we've actually been doing that
now for the last seven years.

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,520
So, in actuality,
according to space adjusted time,

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,800
it is now 2:00 in the afternoon.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,040
Which means, breakfast time!

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
I'll just tuck this napkin in
for you, sir.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
- Thank you.
- There we go.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,520
And I'll just fluff this pillow up.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,560
Fluff, fluff, fluff. There we go, sir.

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Is there anything you don't do for him?

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,320
When he goes to the loo,
do you fit a special hand

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,360
made from three-ply toilet tissue?

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,840
It's an excellent suggestion, sir.
I'll make a note!

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,960
Actually you're all right, Kryts.

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
Erm, what's for breakfast?

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,120
The full Lister, sir.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,840
Ah, the full Lister!

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Eggs, bacon, sausages,
hash browns, onions,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,480
six slices of white toast,

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
double buttered on both sides
with mustard,

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
and a beer milkshake
to wash it all down with.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,920
Ta- da!

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,520
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,120
I must have forgotten to make it.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
What is wrong with me?

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Ah, you're all right, Kryten.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Are you okay?

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,120
How could I be so stupid?

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,720
Stupid, stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid!

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,920
You talking about me?

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,520
Kryts isn't feeling too good.

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Ah, what's up, bud of mine?

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,640
I've been a little distracted of late.

57
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,200
I think I may have lost something
that's fundamental to my very being.

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
One of your nipple nuts
dropped off again?

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
It's nothing like that, sir.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,680
I think I've lost my love of mopping.

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,160
And not just mopping.
Scrubbing, dusting,

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,240
even wiping,
which was always my favourite.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
It's like a little light's
gone out inside.

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,200
Kryten, it's called your sanity circuit.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
What's brought all this on?

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,640
Well, just recently I've started
thinking about the Universe.

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,480
About how cosmic inflation
at the time of the big bang

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,440
means it's constantly expanding

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
until one day it's gonna burst.

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,760
And when it does, everything in
the Universe is gonna cease to exist,

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,200
including the works
of the greatest minds,

72
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,080
Einstein, Mozart, Da Vinci,
Hoover, Dyson, Hotpoint, DustBuster.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,240
And it got me thinking, if everything
in the Universe is going to end,

74
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,240
including time itself, what is the point
in cleaning above eye level?

75
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,440
Good question.

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,360
If one day the Universe
is going to explode,

77
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,440
who cares if the oven is a bit gunky?

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,400
Nothing matters, sir.

79
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
Justice, truth, culture, morality,

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,520
life, death, religion, war.
It's all absurd.

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
Why even get up in the morning?

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
I've been asking that for years!

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
KRYTEN: What am I going to do?

84
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,160
Why don't you take an ice-cold shower?
That'll fix it.

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm not waterproof, sir.

86
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Exactly.

87
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Kryten, what about Silicon Heaven?

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
Does that bring you no comfort?

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Well, just lately I've started to think
that the idea of an afterlife

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,720
for machines is preposterous.

91
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
ALL: No!

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,320
Especially as appliances who are pledged
to the wrong manufacturer

93
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
aren't even allowed in.

94
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,000
It just seems so unfair that all
the Blackberrys burn in Silicon Hell!

95

What's eating you, bud?

96
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
I'm not sure, sir.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,240
Perhaps it's something to do with today
being the anniversary of my creation.

98
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
- Happy creation day, bud!
- Happy creation day.

99
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,400
Yeah, happy creation day.

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
What's got into him?

104
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Wait a minute,
how old did Kryten say he was?

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Three million, give or take
an ice age or two.

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,960
And how long are mechs built to last
before the Grim Ruster comes along?

107
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,080
Another three million?

108
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,600
Give or take an ice age or two.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Well, there's your answer, then.

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,320
Kryten's having a midlife crisis.

111
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,560
What even is a midlife crisis?

112
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,320
I don't think us cats ever get 'em.

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
It's a period when people,
usually halfway through life,

114
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,160
are forced to confront
their own mortality.

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,880
Put it this way, have you ever felt,
"I've wasted my life"?

116
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
You? Sure.

117

No, have you ever felt
you've wasted your life?

119

No!

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,320
Have you ever felt, "There's so much
more I could have been"?

121
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,520
No!

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
Have you ever felt,
"If I went back in time

123
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
"and had my time again, I'd..."
Forget it!

(ELEVATOR RINGS)

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,960
I suppose you can't blame
Kryten for feeling like this.

126
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
He's nearly three million years old,
but what has he got to show for it?

127
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,960
Mozart was five when he wrote
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
Yeah, but what did he do
after that, huh?

129
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,720
He had a bad case of second
nursery-rhyme syndrome, right?

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,960
Mozart, dummy, is one of the greatest
musical gods of all music.

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,360
And after Twinkle, he went on to write
among other things, The Best of Mozart.

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,600
And The Best of Mozart Volume Two.

Kryten, do you know
what a midlife crisis is?

151

Sure do-ski. It's a period of emotional
turmoil in the middle of life.

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,280
Symptoms are usually unexpected anger,

153
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,280
a loss of interest in things
once considered important,

154
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,880

175
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,760
Yes, he's having
a full-on midlife crisis.

176
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,880
Hmm.

177
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,480
Next thing, he'll be leaving us
for a younger crew.

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,720
Look, we need to help him.

179
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,360
What do you suggest? A lunar road trip?

180
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,760
Herding vacuum cleaners?

181
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,120
We've gotta show him how much
he's evolved, how much he's achieved.

182
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,480
He hasn't achieved anything

183
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
because he spends all his time
looking after you!

184
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,200
Oh, get outta town, Rimmer!

185
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,400
He's been independent

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
ever since I helped him
break his programming.

187
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes, independent to look after you!

188
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Okay, how about this, remember years ago
that tech we took from the Nova-5?

189
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
Kryten's old ship?

190
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,880
Yeah, didn't they have
some special FindFleet software?

191
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,440
So that ships could locate each other?

192
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
So what you're suggesting
is we find one of

193
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
"badly damaged parcel head's" old ships?

194
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
We find one with a mech on board.

195
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,920
It'll show Kryten how much he's evolved.

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,280
How long will that take?

197
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,880
Well, once the scanners have located
a ship, to us, it'll be no time at all.

198
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,600
'Cos we'll go into stasis
till we get there.

There's a ship 222 klicks from here.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,080
- Name?
- Nova-3

206
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,280
The 3's were launched
a hundred years before the Nova-5's.

207
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
Any life signs, sir?

208
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,920
One, a mechanoid 3000 Series.

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Goes by the name of 'Butler'.

210
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,240
What's this ship doing out here?

211
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,040
Well, according to the mission log,

212
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,600
they were looking
for a missing research station

213
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,960
that was attempting
to communicate with the Universe.

214
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,440
Back in the day,
there used to be a theory,

215
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,200
now dismissed as preposterous,

216
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,320
that the Universe
was an intelligent entity.

217
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,480
Bet you're really looking forward
to meeting Butler.

218
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,040
He'll probably be unable
to lie, won't he, sir?

219
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,160
Or cheat, deceive, brag, boast,

220
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,800
whinge, exaggerate,
or be proud, pompous or self-important.

221
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,480
In fact, he won't be able
to do any of the things I've taught ya.

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Thinking back, I see now
I've had such a privileged upbringing.

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
Ah, Kryts!

224
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,200
It's going to be like
when you discover someone from school

225
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,760
is doing really badly.

226
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,280
It always gives you
that lovely, warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,240
In fact, I've got a list
I carry around in my man purse

228
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
of all the kids doing worse than me.

229
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
Short list, is it?

230
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
Derek Smetherton.

231
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
He was our head boy.

232
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
Won every prize going,
dated all the best-looking girls,

233
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,680
but he ended up as a bald divorcee

234
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,800
working in a sewage treatment plant
in the Falkland Islands.

235
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,040
And they say there's no God.

236
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,720
Butler!

237
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,480
Kryten, how lovely to meet you.

238
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,680
Follow me and I'll escort you
to our bridge.

239
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,240
Oh, you have a bridge.

240
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,440
How very quaint.

241
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,280
Back on the Nova-5
we had a command room.

242
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,640
Oh, how grand!

243
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,920
Our bridge is nothing
very special, I'm afraid.

244
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,960
I hope you don't mind,
but I prepared some canapes.

245
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,000
I thought you might be peckish
after your journey.

246
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,640
So we have Bleu-Blanc-Coeur
rillettes du Maine,

247
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,440
or if you prefer, bocconcini brochettes

248
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,400
with a tomato and balsamic reduction.

249
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Mmm, yum.

250
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,320
I'll match that yum and raise you a yum
and make it yum-yum!

251
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
Mm.

252
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,120
I hope you like vintage champagne,
Krug Clos du Mesnil 2140.

253
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
Indeed we do.

254
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Derrieres up.

255
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,120
I'll have a beer.

256
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,160
This way.

257
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,640
After the crew died,
I converted this space into a gallery

258
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
so I had somewhere
to keep the paintings.

259
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,560
Ah, the captain had quite a collection.

260
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
These are quite stunning.

261
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,440
Er, no, no, these are
my paintings, Kryten.

262
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,840
You own all these paintings?

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,280
I painted the paintings.

264
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
It gives me a break from the concertos

265
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,640
I put on to entertain
the vending machines.

266
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Are you musical, Kryten?

267
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
Sometimes he hums when he's vacc-ing.

268
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Musical? No, Butler.

269
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,040
But it's long something
I've intended to take up.

270
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,760
"Concerto".
The etymology is fascinating.

271
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,920
It's the conjunction of consorere,
meaning to join, and certome, to fight.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,560
The idea is that the two parts of the
concerto, the soloist and the orchestra,

273
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,880
alternate episodes of opposition

274
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,960
and cooperation in the creation
of the music flow.

275
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,360
Er, this floor, am I right in thinking
you've used our old friend Piney Shine

276
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
with its famed protective coating
and antislip finish?

277
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,200
I must confess I don't recall.

278
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,040
I've been rather distracted lately
finishing my latest novel.

279
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,760
- Reading?
- Writing.

280
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
Splendid.

281
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
What's it about?

282
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,200
It delineates the events surrounding
the droid uprising and invasion

283
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,880
of Callisto back in
the late 22nd century.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,920
And the impact the uprising has on
lunar society

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
as seen through the eyes
of five privileged human families.

286
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,800
Do you write, Kryten?

287
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,640
Shopping lists, laundry lists. That
midnight oil hardly gets a breather.

288
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,840
Rimmer?

289
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,840
Incidentally, if any of you have
any diseases,

290
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,960
I most probably have an antidote.

291
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,320
Breakthrough medical cures
is a hobby of mine.

292
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,200
Do you dabble in medical science?

293
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,160

294
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Yeah, you drink a glass of water

295
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,200
through a straw while sticking
your fingers in your ears.

296
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,200
No, no, no, it so works.

297
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,600
We're expecting the Nobel Prize
for Medicine

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,120
through the cargo bay door any day now.

299
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,920
Before I show you the rest of my ship,
I have to make one thing very clear.

300
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,520
I have no intention of ever leaving
the Nova-3.

301
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
My only captain now is my own muse.

302
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,560
You will join us for
the day, though, surely?

303
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,720
My pleasure.

304
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,600
Rimmer, have you seen
this painting here?

305
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,640
How is this helping Kryten?

306
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Forget Kryten.

307
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
If we can make Butler change his mind,

308
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,960
this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
to update our mech.

309
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,360
What, get rid of Kryten?

310
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
We'll keep him for the cleaning.

Let Butler take care of the science.

312
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,560
I've only had a perfunctory look

313
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,760
but I think I can rather help expand
your EM booster circuits.

314
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Well, sadly,
that won't be possible, Butler.

if you do that, won't the gunships

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,320
My tribe avoid big death
when Butler make skin demons flee.

347
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,720
My pleasure.

348
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,920
And I still treasure the Gelfberry wine
you gave me.

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,920
Best weed killer I've ever had.

350
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,440
My rafflesia arnoldiis
absolutely love it.

You're too kind.

353
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,640
Equahecta has promised to safely escort
us back to Red Dwarf.

354
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
We must thank him.

355
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,960
On behalf of all the Red Dwarf crew
let me say:

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,160
Ajaj magalaj majenhe majah jmahj

00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,440

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,480

- Maaar.

360
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,600
- No, it's... It's in the throat. Maaarr.
- Maaar.

361
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,480
- No, Maaarrr.
- Maaar.

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,560
- Maaarrr.
- (ALL TOGETHER) Maaarrr.

366
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,680
- That's it. Maaarrr.
- RIMMER: Maaarr.

367
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
- Maaarrr.
- Maaarr. Maaarr.

368
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,240
ALL: Maaarr. Maaarr. Maaarr.

369
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,080
Yeah, that's, er... That's quite close.

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,640
The Sakjenjakho dialect's

371
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,080
a little trickier to master
than the Kinitawowi.

372
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,440
Later, I'd be happy to go over it
with you.

373
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
That'll be most useful.

374
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,320
Oh, I forgot to ask.

375
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,400
Equahecta, how is Bacnacnegath?

His father is dying of fever.

378
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,560
Oh, do you have a cure, Butler?

379
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
Well, possibly, it's hard to say without
seeing him.

380
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,920
Well, then you must go.
Go, be gone and go!

They'll teleport me aboard their ship

384
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
and then afterwards return me
to the Nova-3

385
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
I must bid you farewell.

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Perhaps we could get together
sometime soon?

388
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,360
I have the Nova-3's handshake
frequencies written right here, sir.

389
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,280
Good luck, my friends, and may every day
bring us each a little more wisdom.

394
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,400
Hey, it's my watch.

395
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
No need, sir, I'm happy to do it.

396
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,800
How you doing?

397
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,680
I'd just like to have been better
than Butler at something.

398
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,400
Just one small,
tiny, itty, bitty thing.

399
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,160
- I had a midlife crisis once.
- You didn't say.

400
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,720
Yeah, it was about three years ago.

401
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,160
Had all the classic symptoms.
First, I denied it, then I got angry.

402
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
Then I started thinking about
missed opportunities.

403
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,920
Then I got depressed.

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,280
And then, finally, I accepted it.

405
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,720
How long did this whole thing last, sir?

406
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
About five minutes.

407
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,360
Five minutes?

408
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,880
Yeah, I just thought,
"Dave, you're getting older. Move on."

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
Just like that?

410
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,920
That's how you have a midlife crisis
in the North, Kryts.

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
Bish, bosh, done!

412
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,280
We don't toss about.

413
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,920
I wish I could be the same, sir,
but I just can't.

414
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,640
Things didn't exactly go to plan
back there, did they?

415
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,640
It really brought home to me what a
wretched failure my whole life has been.

416
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Butler is several generations before me
and yet he's done so much more with

417
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,400
- what he's been given.

What the smeg was that?

420
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
It's the EM boosters. Of course!

421
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,600
Butler, the damn fool, he didn't realise
that unlike the Nova-3,

422
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,240
all our boards have universal linkage.

423
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,400

- Meaning?

424

- The engines are going to burn out, sir!

425
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,600

- He'll look absolutely stupid!

426
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,800
- (HIGH-PITCHED DRONING)
- Doesn't that mean we're going to crash?

427
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,720
- (HIGH-PITCHED DRONING)
- How stupid is he going to look then?

428
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,480
- (HIGH-PITCHED DRONING)
- Yeah, but say we die?

429
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,960

- Even better!

430
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,280
- (HIGH-PITCHED DRONING)
- Is there no way we can land and repair?

431
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,560
Well, we could, but why should we help
Butler out?

432
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,520
- (HIGH-PITCHED DRONING)
- Kryten!

433
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh, my jealousy chip
is overloading, sir!

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,560
Return to sane mode.

435
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,560
- Of course we should land.
- Where?

436
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,400
Anywhere, before the whole board
is infected.

437
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,520
Turning all power off now.

438
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,520
Couldn't we make it back to Red Dwarf?

439
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Too many course adjustments.

440
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,040
We need to find somewhere
along our present line of velocity.

441
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,840
Okay, scanning. Scanning. Scanning.
There!

442
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,080
It's about nine hours from here.
We can make it.

443
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,600
Take over!

444
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,840
I'll go and tell the others.

445
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,640
And don't forget to tell them
whose fault it was.

446
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,800
Perhaps I'm going to give you a call
after all.

447
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,360
RIMMER: This is perfect.

448
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,480
KRYTEN: All we need is a power source
to set up the adjustment array.

449
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,280
CAT: SIU. What's that?

450
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,760
KRYTEN: "The Search for an Intelligent
Universe."

451
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,760
This must've been the missing space
station the Nova-3 was looking for.

452
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,640
The Universe, so some scientists
believe, is a living entity.

453
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,920
So they built a space station
to communicate with it?

454
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,640
No doubt armed with Rizlas
the length of ski bags.

455
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,960
Well, judging by a cursory glance
through the crew files, sir,

456
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,480
they all appear to be leading pioneers
in their fields.

457
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,360
And I think we all know
what was growing in their fields.

458
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,960
Do you think any communication ever take

459
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,720
place between these scientists
and the Universe?

460
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,040
KRYTEN: It appears not.

461
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
Maybe they called and
the Universe was out?

462
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,280
More likely the scientists were
long dead

463
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,200
before the computers completed
their billions of calibrations.

464
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,600
Look at that.

465
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
- (PHONE BEEPING)
- Is that call waiting?

466
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,520
It appears as if
the Universe is on hold, sir.

467
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,200
No way has it been waiting
all this time.

468
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,000
It's going to be seriously smegged off.

469
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Not as smegged off as Butler
when he finds out what we've discovered.

470
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,960
Leave this to me.

471
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,720
Hello.

472
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,320
Is there anyone there?

473
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,640
UNIVERSE: Yes, I am here.

474
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,600
RIMMER: To whom am I speaking, please?

475
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,520
UNIVERSE: I am the entity known
to you as the Universe.

476
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
Ah, Mr Universe, sir.

477
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,320
It's not Mr Universe, Rimmer.

478
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,800
That's some geezer with pecks
and a posing pouch.

479
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
- Ask him the meaning of life.
- Hang on.

480
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,960
How can we know for certain
that you are indeed The Universe?

481
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,000
UNIVERSE: I am the Universe.

482
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,880
I am everything.

483
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I am the entire contents of space.

484
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,480
I am all matter and energy.

485
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,360
I am time.

486
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,840
I am the totality of all existence.

487
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,320
Says you.

488
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,240
But can you prove it?

489
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,840
LISTER: What are you asking for, Rimmer,
a utility bill?

490
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,440
Photo ID? A spend and save card?

491
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,160
Look, let me take over.

492
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,840
- There you go, Kryten, you're up.
- Sir?

493
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,000
All your worries about the big burst,
the meaning of life...

494
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,840
Now's your chance. Ask the Universe.

495
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,360
KRYTEN: Perhaps you can help, sir.

496
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,560
I've been struggling of late
to comprehend the point of existence.

497
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,240
UNIVERSE: Explain.

498
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,400
KRYTEN: Well, if you're going to die
in 14 billion years' time,

499
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,240
what's the point in anything?

500
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,800
UNIVERSE: Wait. I'm gonna die?

501
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
KRYTEN: Well, yes.

502
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,320
UNIVERSE:
What, in just 14 billion years' time?

503
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,920
I'm halfway through my life, then.

504
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,720
No wonder I'm not as hot as I once was.

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,560
No wonder I'm expanding exponentially.

506
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,320
You've just sent the Universe
into a full-on midlife crisis.

507
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,560
Oh, my.

508
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,520
UNIVERSE: Halfway through my life and

509
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,000
I've only ever created one lousy,
stupid planet with intelligent life.

510
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,680
And that's debatable.

511
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,240
UNIVERSE: What have I been
doing all this time?

512
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,040
KRYTEN: Well, making life from nothing
is really rather tricky, sir.

513
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,800
- You've done rather well.
- Wait.

514
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,400
UNIVERSE: If... If I die,
and I leave nothing behind,

515
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,120
my life has no meaning
and existence is senseless.

516
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,920
Ain't that right?

517
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
- No.
- No?

518
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,480
I've been thinking about this.

519
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,600
If you created everything
in the Universe,

520
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,720
then you must have created love.

521
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,960
And it strikes me that
there may be no God

522
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,840
and no afterlife, no one knows.

523
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,240
But we do know love exists.

524
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,920
And if it does, then life has meaning.

525
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,160
Let's hear it for the Universe.

526
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,520
Great job, guy.

527
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,560
UNIVERSE: That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

528
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,360
I must confess
I feel a whole lot better.

529
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,680
So do I

530
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,400
Is there any advice you can give us
before we jog on?

531
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
- UNIVERSE: Yes.
- RIMMER: What?

532
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Kryten, take off that suit.

533
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
It really sucks!

534
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,080
What a very strange day.

535
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,040
Strange, but reassuring.

536
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,160
I realise now,
we're all in the same boat.

537
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,600
Even the Universe.

538
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,520
And even though the boat has a hole
in it, at least we get to see the sea.

539
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,800
(DIALLING RADIO BUTTONS)

540
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,440
Ah, Butler, it's Kryten.

541
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm calling to say hi
and thank you for today.

542
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,680
Not at all.

543
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,720
Incidentally, when we left you,
we stumbled across a space station.

544
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,720
And the most incredible thing,
it turned out to be

545
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,400
the space station you were looking for,
and guess what?

546
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,760
We actually talked to the Universe,
the actual Universe itself.

547
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
What do you make of that?

548
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,160
Oh, you know the Universe.

549
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,240
You call him Uni?

550
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,200
You purposefully expanded our EM circuit
so I'd meet him?

551
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,720
You thought it might help me?

552
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,800
You have him on speed dial?

553
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,520
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

554
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,760
# I'm all alone, more or less

555
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,040
# Let me fly far away from here

556
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,880
# Fun, fun, fun

557
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,480
# In the sun, sun, sun

558
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,240
# I want to lie
shipwrecked and comatose

559
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,280
# Drinking fresh mango juice

560
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,760
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

561
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,640
# Fun, fun, fun

562
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,040
# In the sun, sun, sun

563
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,240
# Fun, fun, fun

564
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,840
# In the sun, sun, sun #
