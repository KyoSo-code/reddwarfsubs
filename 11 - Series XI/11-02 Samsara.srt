Five. One, two, three, four, five. Fuel.

Well?

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,480

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,080
In the Space Scouts, my game play was
so legendary they called me Minotaur.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,080
Is that 'cause you were
half a man who was full of bull?

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,840
Because I was like the mythological
beast that no one could pass.

15
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,520
Well, you'd better not throw
a two and a one then, Rimmer.

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
Throw a two and a one
and land on my space station,

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
and your bank is rupted, baby.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,920

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I can leave pizza on the floor
so that you step in it,

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
I can even snore
like an inebriated warthog

gonna be one winner here...

And that's vôtres truly.

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,880

- No willing it.

I'm allowed to will it, I'm willing it.

It doesn't count, I used my hands,
an illegal move, naughty me.

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
Re-throw required.

and a one and you lost this game?

Okay, I accept it.

we any idea what it is yet?

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,440
It's an escape pod, sir,

56
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
and it seems to be emitting
an unclassified energy field

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,840
that's causing minute disruptions
to everything in the local vicinity.

58
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,520
Pretty much as I figured then.

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,720

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
What happened? Did we lose the link?

65
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,280
No matter, sir, I'll remote control
the pod into the Cargo Bay.

And no complaining about not being
able to complain about not complaining.

I am cursed.

76
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,920
I remember the day it happened.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,800
I was nine years old,
and this busker claimed

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,800
he was an alien who wanted
to sell me some lucky space dust.

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,640
Even at nine I was no fool,
I knew he was real.

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
But all I had was my hover fare to get
me home from baton twirling practise.

81
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,080
And as I walked off,
he cursed me for life

82
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,080
and I've never had any luck since.

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,440
It was just some homeless bloke,
Rimmer, trying to make a buck,

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
you can't take
things like that seriously.

Smeg happens, you just roll with it.

86
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,360
I've been rolling in smeg
my whole damn life, Lister.

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,880
Don't lecture me about smeg rolling.

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,520
I never get the breaks.

89
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,520
Oh, here we go, whereas you...

90
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
- Whereas you...
- Lead a charmed life.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
Lead a charmed life.
Well, it's true, you do.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm alone in deep space with you,
how charmed is that?

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,000
The crew got wiped out,
you survived, that's charmed.

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,480
I survived to live the rest of
my life with you, not charmed.

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,240
I'm dead, how unlucky is that?

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,960
You're dead, but you're still
talking! To me, how unlucky is that?

98
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,440
Sorry, sirs, the bing-bong machine
is being serviced this evening.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,040
I'm afraid we're on manual.

100
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,640
Sorry to disturb, but we've salvaged
an escape pod with two survivors,

101
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,800
one Colonel Jim Green
and one Professor Rachel Barker.

102
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,520
We're just about to open the booth

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,280
and take them to the science room
for debriefing.

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Message ends. Bing bong.

105
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
Acting Senior
Commanding Officer Arnold J. Rimmer,

106
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
an absolute pleasure to meet you.

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,080
Sir, Colonel Green and Professor Barker.

108
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,680
They're dead.

109
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Hey, the medical reports aren't in yet,
we shouldn't jump to conclusions.

110
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,680
We spoke to Barker
then the link went down.

111
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,840
When we opened the pod,
we discovered this.

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,040
What happened?

113
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,840
Well, they appear to
have been vaporised, sir.

114
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
Quite how and why we're not sure.

115
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
What do we know about them?

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, the log tells us that Green

117
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,320
was the ship's human
exploration and mission director.

118
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
Barker was a computer scientist,

119
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,000
they were both married,
but not to each other.

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,560
Surprising, they look like
they'd be the perfect match.

121
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,000
What became of the ship
the escape pod escaped from?

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
The SS Samsara.

123
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
Have we any idea what happened to that?

124
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
Well, judging from
the pod's flight recorder

125
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,320
and the fact that there's no wreckage,

126
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,320
we believe the ship must've
crashed onto this ocean moon.

127
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,480
It seems to me we should do two things.

128
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,240
One, scatter the ashes
and two, find this ship.

129
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
(SNEEZES)

130
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,160
Onto two then, find this ship.

131
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,640
LISTER: So, what are
we hoping to find here?

132
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Faster-than-light drive,
quantum computer.

133
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,400
Well, to be honest,
I'd settle for a bubble gum dispenser.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,080
Wow.

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,760
I wonder what happened
to Barker and Green.

136
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Wrist, please? Thank you.

137
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
Wrist, please?

138
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,880
Sirs, Professor Barker
reporting for duty.

139
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,840
Welcome to the Samsara, Professor.

140
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,480
- This is my colleague Colonel Green.
- Barker.

141
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,320
We were both stationed on Cacos 12, sir.

142
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,640
Ah, Cacos 12. Of course, yes.

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,040
We discovered my wife attended
the same college as your husband.

144
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
- Yeah.
- I must get on,

145
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
I'll catch up with you later, Jim.

146
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,040
Now, remind me, you were
a computer scientist specialising in...

147
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
What was it again?

148
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,560
(GIGGLES) I've missed you so much.

149
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,960
I thought you would
never get the transfer.

150
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Nor me.

151
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
Let's go to my quarters.

152
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,960
Look at this dust.

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,400
I love dust.

154
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,320
After fluff,
it's my all-time favourite dirt.

155
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,320
CAT: Do you have any idea what
caused this crate to crash?

156
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,920
Nothing yet, sir.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,480
It's a state-of-the-art research ship
with self-repairing engine parts.

158
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Crashing should've
been out of the question.

159
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
What's this?

160
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,760
Well, I can see why they crashed.

161
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,440
Tell me about it.

162
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,000
How can you fly a space ship and at
the exact same time all play Twister?

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,840
I don't think it was Twister
they were playing.

164
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,160
Not properly, that's for sure.

165
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,640
Twister is a three-player game,
everyone here's just waded right in.

166
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,840
Hey, wait your turn, buddy,
what's the rush?

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,160
This is worse than
fresher's week at art school.

168
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
How did they die like this?
It doesn't make sense.

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,800
According to the SI scan,
they were flash-heated to death.

170
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,720
An instant blast of extreme

A cold chill has just
run straight down my spine.

That was me, I just spilt
some lager down your back.

178
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
The mainframe probably detected us.

Hmm.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,120
According to his dog tag,
this man was the captain, Tom Kadri.

182
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
Indecipherable gibberish.

183
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,000
What kind of writing's that? GELF?

184
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,000
Looks like Welsh after about 15 pints.

185
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,400
Strange, that dialect
is not on my database.

186
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,760
Maybe it is Welsh after about 15 pints.

187
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
I wonder.

188
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,640
Sir, do you mind sitting down?

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,000
What, me?

190
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
- Permission to strangle you, sir?
- What?

192
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Granted.

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,040
So, maybe, the captain was strangled
by this person here who's been stabbed.

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,240
Perhaps the next hub will offer a clue.

Why can't I take money
from the orphan fund?

I think so.

294
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,880
What is that?

295
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,040
I believe it's a Karma Drive, sir.

296
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
A what?

297
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
It's based on the old Justice World tech

298
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,480
where the pain
an individual inflicts on another

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,560
is redirected back on them,
with one important difference.

300
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,720
The Karma Drive has two modes,

301
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,240
a punishment setting
and a reward setting.

302
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,440
What's the point of that?

303
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,600
They were designed
for long-haul space missions.

304
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,960
They were intended to promote teamwork,

305
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,280
reward kindness,
understanding and ethical behaviour.

306
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,800
So how does it work exactly?

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,600
Well, it creates a karma field that
analyses behaviour

308
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,080
and then manipulates reality
to reward or punish.

309
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,040
So when you behave ethically,
the ship rewards you.

310
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,520
How?

311
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,760
Well, your coffee is fresh,
your shower is warm, your food is tasty.

312
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,280
But that doesn't make sense.

313
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,960
Morality changes
across time and cultures.

314
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,280
Once slavery was
an accepted way of life,

315
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,480
now it's considered repugnant.

316
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,680
Who decides what's immoral and moral?

317
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,480
Well, it's programmable, sir,

318
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
and that's what made the Karma Drive
such a dangerous piece of kit.

319
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,480
Anyone can implement
their moral code of their choice

320
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,400
and then force others to live by it.

321
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,400
I wonder if that's what happened to me
on Red Dwarf when I lost at Mine-opoly.

322
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
Did Red Dwarf
enter the Karma Drive's field?

323
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,920
Was the drive
manipulating the dice somehow?

324
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,480
I don't understand, sir.

325
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
I threw a two and a one seven times
in a row, what are the odds of that?

326
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,040
62 million-to-one, sir.

327
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,200
About the same odds
as being killed by a tangerine.

328
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,520
Why punish me?
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

329
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,320
Kryten, this Karma Drive
is too unpredictable,

330
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,000
we've got to get out of here pronto.

331
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,040
Sir, there is no cause for alarm,

332
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,600
we're under no danger

333
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,200
as long as we don't do anything
vindictive, selfish or unethical.

334
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,160
Kryten, we're in big trouble.

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,560
Sir, you just have to be nice to me.

336
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,800
Big, big trouble.

337
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,120
The Karma Drive report has
just come down from central ops

338
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,760
and it doesn't make
for pleasant reading.

339
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,840
You both have committed
a whole range of misdemeanours.

340
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
There's a Karma Drive on board?

- We get the picture.
- It goes on.

345
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,560
You, Rachel, have lied this week
to your husband and others 93 times.

346
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,800
That's just not true.

347
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
94 times.

348
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,640
You've been unkind 20 times,
criticised others 40 times

349
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,040
and not said thank you twice?!

350
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
Captain, we're in love.

351
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,680
When you signed up
for this tour of duty, you agreed

352
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,160
to abide by the moral code
selected for this ship.

353
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
So, we're all supposed
to live the MegaCorp dream?

354
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,600
Where the married stay married
and sons call their fathers "sir"

355
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,200
and everyone eats
lots of homemade apple pie?

356
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
You got it, so start squirting
your whipped cream on apple pie

357
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,320
and not on one another's body parts.

358
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,320
Hey, good job on the foot, bud.

359
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,840
Yeah, I even managed to save the boot.

360
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,200
We've got to think of
a way to get out of here.

361
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Ah, just give me like 10 minutes.
I bet I come up with a plan.

362
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,080
I get great ideas all the time.

363
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,800
I just don't say 'em out loud.

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
You say everything you think out loud.

365
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,520
I'm like that inventor guy,
that begins with "R".

366
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Rosenthal? Sidney Rosenthal?

367
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,320
- Who?
- Invented the magic marker.

368
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,640
Magic marker?

369
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,520
The guy I'm talking about is real.

370
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
He ain't no wizard out
of a book with his magic pen.

371
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Inventor guy? Begins with "R"...

372
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
I got it, I got it!

373
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,480
The inventor guy
I'm like, it begins with "R".

374
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,640
- Who?
- Archimedes.

375
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,160
Archimedes.

376
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
Archimedes.

377
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,080
The guy that sat under
trees and invented stuff.

378
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,000
- That was Newton.
- You never heard this story?

379
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,760
So, one day Archimedes
is sitting under a tree,

380
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,920
then, all of a sudden out of nowhere,
this bath hits him on the head, pow!

381
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
And he gets up, shouts, "Formica!"
and invents gravy.

382
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,320
It was Newton who was sat under
the tree and he discovered gravity

383
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,160
when he got hit on the head by an apple.

384
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,400
An apple can't concuss ya.

385
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
That ain't gonna
make you stagger around

386
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,240
shout, "Formica!" and invent gravy.

387
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,280
Formica is a heat-resistant,
wipe-clean, plastic laminate.

388
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
Who'd shout "Formica"?

389
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,200
It doesn't make any sense,
no one shouts, "Formica".

390
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,120
You get hit on the head with a bath,
everyone shouts, "Formica!"

391
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,640
Look, Archimedes discovered
something to do with water displacement

392
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,360
when he was sat in the bath
and he shouted, "Eureka!"

393
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,960
So, Mr Alan Einstein...

394
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,640
Answer me this, who invented gravy?

395
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,240
No one?

396
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,200
Did it just magically appear one day
like your stupid wizard pen?

397
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm going to have some painkillers.

398
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,200
Okay, listen.

399
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Answer me this,
how does a bath fall out of a tree?

400
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,520
A plane, dummy.

401
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,520
Taking off. They probably
forgot to shut the back door

402
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,960
and the bath slipped
all the way from First Class,

403
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,000
whoosh, through
the curtains into Business,

404
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,200
whoosh, through
the curtains into Premium,

405
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,800
whoosh, through the curtains

406
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,840
and straight into
the poor people section.

407
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
Coincidentally, probably still
haven't even had a bag of peanuts,

408
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,120
while the dudes in First
have already eaten,

409
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,040
watched the movie
and are all now having a bath.

410
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Meanwhile, Archi is sitting
under his tree?

411
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
Clang, invents gravy.

412
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,640
Then, because everyone's so damn happy
because everyone loves gravy, right?

413
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,040
They gave him a special hat to wear
at night to cover up the bruising.

414
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,200
Special hat?

415
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,560
They gave him a knighthood.

416
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
A knighthood.

417
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,240
Not a special hat to wear
at night to cover up the bruising.

418
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,520
Man, I try to teach you stuff,
I don't know why I bother.

419
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,240
What's that saying?

420
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,680
You can lead a hearse to water,
but you can't make it sink.

421
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,160
Kryten!

422
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
Help!

423
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
(SHIP RUMBLING)

424
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,400
720 meters, sir,
the ship's nearly at crush depth.

425
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,560
The Karma Drive
is controlling everything on board.

426
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,520
We have to be kind to one another

427
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,400
to stand any chance
to save Mr Lister and Mr Cat.

428
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,640
An excellent suggestion, Kryten,

429
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,280
that's very insightful of you
to make such a helpful recommendation

430
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
and I thank you greatly.

431
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,160
- (CRACKLING)
- Aah!

432
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,280
Static.

433
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,560
I was complimenting you.
Why did it punish me?

434
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,920
Well, perhaps, it wasn't genuine, sir.

435
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,200
I've got to be genuinely nice?

436
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,080
Oh, this is impossible.

437
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,560
(BEEPING)

438
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,920
- Oh, dear.
- What?

439
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,800
I think I know
what killed the crew, sir.

440
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,880
The ship's quantum motherboards

441
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,200
are power loading
to flash-heat the ship.

442
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,000
We're gonna get flash-heated?

443
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,320
- How long have we got?
- I'm not sure, sir.

444
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,760
Why am I asking you?

445
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,000
Someone with a head
shaped like something produced

446
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,800
in a geriatric's pottery class.

447
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
(POWERING DOWN)

448
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Oh!

449
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,080
The power loading has stopped, sir.

450
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,520
The temperature's cooling?

451
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,960
- Why?
- Of course, that's it.

452
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
(LAUGHS)

453
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,880
Man, she was the greatest
soldier in history,

454
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,800
led her people to victory.

455
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,360
Julie Caesar?

456
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,800
Kryten, thank God!

457
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,960
Thank God.

458
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,040
No one should have to suffer like this.

459
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,760
He's right,
if I wasn't there for him to talk to,

460
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,520
he'd probably have gone crazy.

461
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,920
Kryten, man, it's so good to see you.

462
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,960
- Sir, stop!
- Stop what?

463
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,160
You stand there with
your 1970s cover band haircut

464
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
and I say to you don't be nice to me.

465
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
(GROANS)

466
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,800
We know what happened to Barker.

467
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
(GROANS)

468
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,960
And Green.

469
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,880
What happened to you?

470
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,360
Your hair's insane.

471
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,520
I went to the ship salon for a makeover.
Look what the robo-stylist did to me.

472
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,920
Yeah, similar thing
happened to me at the dentist.

473
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,440
Every chance it gets,
the Karma Drive is punishing us,

474
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,440
the showers are freezing,
the air-con's icy,

475
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,880
I had to wait two hours yesterday...

476
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
(RETCHING)

477
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,120
Have you tasted the food?

478
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,520
Jim, I can't take this anymore.

479
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,760
- We've got no choice.
- Yes, we do.

480
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,120
I am a computer scientist
for God's sakes.

481
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,360
If I can access the KD's mainframe,
then perhaps I can reverse the protocol,

482
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,120
give us some respite,
even if it is only for one night.

483
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,720
Reverse?

484
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
So, it rewards the unethical
and punishes the good?

485
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,600
Just the one night,
then we'll stop seeing each other

486
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,680
till we get back home.

487
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,480
Barker and Green reversed the protocols

488
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,360
and, as a consequence,
good behaviour was punished

489
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,720
and immoral behaviour was rewarded.

490
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,720
Kryten just figured it out,
saved all our necks.

491
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,560
Kryten, if you weren't so ugly,
I could kiss you.

492
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,760
Well, you could shake my hand, sir.

493
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,320
Still too ugly.

494
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
(POWERING UP)

495
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,640
You see? Unkindness rewarded.

496
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,320
This is all beginning to make sense.

497
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,440
I mean, think back. I mean, the Cat
nicked the money out of the orphan fund

498
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,920
to play the one-armed bandit.

499
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,360
And I won the jackpot.

500
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,720
You were rewarded for stealing.

501
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,360
And I put the winnings
back into the orphan can

502
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,080
and got me locks caught in a shredder.

503
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,680
You were punished for being benevolent.

504
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,040
I saved him and got a knife in my foot.

505
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,360
I fixed his foot...

506
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
And he got to spend
quality time with me.

507
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,920
Moving swiftly on.

508
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,600
Who reversed the protocols and why?

509
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,840
Well, best guess, Green and
Barker were having an affair

510
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,280
and wanted to spend time together.

511
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
How sad is that?

512
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,840
I mean, basically their love for one
another brought down the entire ship.

513
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,680
One thing I don't understand.

514
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,120
Well, actually there are about
40 things I don't understand.

515
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,320
How come Green and Barker weren't
flash-heated with the rest of the crew?

516
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,040
While the rest of the crew
survived by acting immorally,

517
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,680
Green and Barker
realised they could escape

518
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,680
so long as that escape was unethical.

519
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,480
So they took the ship's
only escape pod and fled.

520
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,880
And then they went into
cryo-sleep for millions of years.

521
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,000
Where they were safe.

522
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,680
But when they tried to
warn us about the karma field,

523
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
an act of kindness...

524
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
The Karma Drive had them vaporised.

525
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,520
So where does that leave us?

526
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,920
It leaves us getting
the hell out of here really carefully.

527
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,480
We just have to remember
to avoid being honest,

528
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,360
moral, kind, selfless and helpful.

529
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,640
It's not fair,
you've got such an advantage.

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,080
Hey, what's that?

531
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
"Fuel tax, miss three goes."

532
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,160
Hey, how come you got so many
Mine-opoly cards in your pocket?

533
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,360
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

534
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,760
# I'm all alone, more or less

535
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,000
# Let me fly far away from here

536
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,920
# Fun, fun, fun

537
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,040
# In the sun, sun, sun

538
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,040
# I want to lie,
shipwrecked and comatose

539
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,920
# Drinking fresh mango juice

540
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,640
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

541
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,280
# Fun, fun, fun

542
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,680
# In the sun, sun, sun

543
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,640
# Fun, fun, fun

544
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,520
# In the sun, sun, sun #
