(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,160
(BEEPING)

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Ah, what's this?

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,920
I salvaged it from the Medistation, sir.
It's a personality tuck machine.

5
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,840
Mmm, so it can perform
corrective surgery on your character?

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,840
Exactly. It scans the patient's brain
and forms a personality map.

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,200
It's then able to enhance, remove,

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,800
even sculpt the very traits
that make that person who they are.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,280
Hypothetically...
I'm speaking hypothetically here,

10
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,160
do you think I could do
with a little work?

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,720
Take a seat, sir.
I'll cancel this week's schedule.

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,000
So, what can you do for me exactly?

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,760
I'll begin by just working out the areas
I think we might be able to improve.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,760
Now here, here, here,

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,240
here, here, definitely here.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,760
Yes, all right, Kryten,
get on with it, man.

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Well, take your pomposity,
large and unsightly.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,360
Your self-importance, too,
is massively engorged.

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,600
What's that huge area
in the middle there?

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
Well, that is your cowardice, sir.

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,600
Perhaps you'd like me to perform
a cowardectomy?

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,360
What, reduce it. A sort of
wimpoplasty?

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
Hey, what's happening, buds?

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm about to perform
some personality surgery on Mr Rimmer.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,720
He's getting a new personality?
Great idea.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
Not new, moulded, tightened,
lifted, shaped.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
This is gonna transform me.

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm gonna be the lady-melting enormous
bald stud muffin I've always dreamt of.

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,040
Now, Kryten, one thing.
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,760
There'll just be the slightest,

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,960
- Infinitesimally tiny little scratch.
- Scratch?

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,920
- Well, when I insert the laser.
- Laser?

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,320
- Well, it has to burn...
- Burn?

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,200
Well, perhaps I should give you
a holo-sedative, sir.

35
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
- With a needle?
- Sir, please.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,040
I'll talk you through every aspect
of the procedure step by step.

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,880
Right now, I'm just in the...
W- where's he gone?

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
Out the door and left.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, Einstein was wrong. It is possible
to break the speed of light.

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
(ALARM SOUNDING)

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,400
What the...

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,560
Guys? Keep the noise down,
I'm trying to sleep here.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Whoa! What's going on?
We're way off course here.

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,400
Who's the joker in charge of navigation?

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,920
You are, sir.

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,240
Seriously? Oh, man.
I think I might've dosed off.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Lister, we're 5,000 klicks off course.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,280
All you had to do was engage autopilot,
your watch, your fault.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,920
You can't blame me for this.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
What kind of lunch was that
to give your pilot?

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,080
Roast beef with all the trimmings,
followed by seconds,

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,240
followed by sticky toffee pudding,
followed by seconds,

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,320
followed by beer and coffee and cheese
and brandy and port and cigars

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,160
and that little chocolate mint.

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,800
What chance did I stand
after a Sunday lunch like that?

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,040
- How long have I been out?
- It's Monday, sir.

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,280
Oh, man. No way.

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,560
It's gonna take us forever
to get back to Red Dwarf now.

59
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Maybe we could take a short cut
across that asteroid belt.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
GELF country?

61
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,800
If the stories are to be believed,

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,760
the particular tribe of GELF
that inhabit belt Juno 98

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,960
are the... (GIBBERISH)

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Oh, sorry.
I just sat down on a screwdriver.

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,080
Why does nobody tidy up around here
except me?

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Kryten, you were saying?

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm sorry, sir, yes, that particular
tribe are the Nacky Ninckers.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,800
Vampire GELFs to you and me.

69
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,280
Vampire GELFs?

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,320
The story goes they feast
on the blood of virgins.

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
Feast on the blood of virgins(!)

72
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
Who believes that? Taking her in.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Wait a minute, hang on here,
slow the hell down.

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,480
- What's the problem?
- I'm just curious.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
How do they tell the virgins
from the non-virgins?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,840
Well, according to the ancient myths,
they can smell them.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Smell 'em?
What the hell does a virgin smell of?

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Desperation, normally.

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,440
Actually, sir, the actual science is

80
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,360
that the GELFs can smell the pheromone
produced by fear.

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,720
Only the virgins are scared,

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
so they're the only ones
producing the fear pheromone.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
- Thus no issue for us.
- Taking her in.

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,160
Hang on, hold up. Can we discuss this
for one stupid, lousy second?

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,400
- Hang on a minute, are you...
- No.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
- I suppose you must...
- No!

87
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,600
- I never really...
- Don't even say it.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
Okay. Moving on.

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,360
Didn't mean to open up
a can of worms here.

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,680
I've had my share, let me tell ya.

91
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
More than my share.

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Plus I've had full blown
love affairs, too.

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,600
Well, yes, mirror in the bathroom,

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,640
mirror in the hall...
I'd forgotten about those.

95
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
Don't you guys know that cats always
have two homes?

96
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,480
I got a lady cat back on Red Dwarf.

97
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,840
- Hell, I got two.
- On Zed deck.

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
- On Zed deck.
- On Zed deck.

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,240
Exactly. That's where they are,
on Zed deck.

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,360
But hiding from you guys, because
they're only interested in me.

101
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,800
We will go the long way 'round.

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,320
And be quick about it, because I gotta
get back to my lady cats on Zed deck.

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,240
I'm suddenly starting
to miss 'em real bad.

104
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
(SOBBING)

105
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
(MONITOR BEEPS)

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm picking up a ship.

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
The energy signature's
barely registering.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,360
The signal's weaker than
the San Marino reserve team.

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Posting, logging into their mainframe.

110
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,160
Don't bother, in this region of space,
it could well be a GELF battle cruiser.

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,320
Maintain current course.

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,840
That gets my vote.

113
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,280
According to the hack,
it's a transport ship, crew two,

114
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,200
one Mercenoid, one prisoner.

115
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,520
A merce-what?

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,560
A Mercenoid is a droid, sir,
who has agreed to sacrifice his life

117
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,760
in exchange for software updates
in silicone heaven.

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,280
These Mercenoids are nuttier
than a vegetarian breakfast.

119
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,480
That probably explains why
the Mercenoid and his prisoner

120
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,360
are on a death dive into
the heart of a super-massive black hole.

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
So what now?

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,040
We're gonna board that crate
before it passes the event horizon.

123
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,480
Risk our necks for one prisoner?

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,360
Rimmer, that prisoner might be human,
we can't just abandon them.

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,080
Never say can't, Lister.

126
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,760
You put your mind to it,
there's no limit to who you can abandon.

127
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,880
All right, Cat, take her in,
Rimmer lend me your Dictaphone.

128
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,440
What, why?

129
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
Because I've got an idea.

130
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Right. Come on, let's do this.

131
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,080
Good luck, keep in touch.

132
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
RIMMER: More ship intel
coming through via the hack.

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,200
They were transporting scientific
equipment to a bio-station on Orta 15.

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
Something doesn't smell right.

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
The ship's log's been deleted and
the black box has also been wiped clean.

136
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm not getting any pictures
from your head cam.

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,000
There must be some kind of signal block
in place.

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
How about now?

139
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,520
Yes, getting pictures now.
What did you do?

140
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh, I just recalibrated
the fluctuation drive band signal.

141
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,920
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

142
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
You're not gonna like this,

143
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
but I'm picking up something
in the movement tracker.

144
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,520
Life signs, organic and part organic,
in corridor Beta 12.

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
Where exactly in Beta 127

146
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,800
RIMMER: At the south entrance.

147
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
That's where we are.

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,120
Then you should be able to see them,
they're there right on top of you.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,560
They may be in the ceiling
or under the floor, run!

150
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,360
Go back, get out of there! Move!
Now! Forwards!

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
Not that way the other way!

152
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
No, the other way.

153
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
Lister, move!

154
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

155
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,360
Could these life signs...

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,280
Could they, by any chance, be us?

157
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,160
Ah, yes, of course.

158
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,200
Organic and part organic. Yes, it's you.

159
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,560
They should warn you about that
in the instruction manual

160
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,080
Someone could come along
and make a right idiot of himself.

161
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,560
Ah, it does mention it.

162
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,120
It's this bit here in big red capitals.

163
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
So easy to miss.

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm picking up EM emissions.
This way, sirs.

165
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,320
MERCENOID:
I know you are here, humies.

166
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,800
If you want to live, you must leave.

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,400
He's right, I think we should go.

168
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,960
- Sir...
- You haven't seen him. Okay.

169
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,400

Extremely disturbing news, sir.

According to the Mercenoid's black box,

216
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,880
that cat we brought on Red Dwarf
is not a felis sapien.

217
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,600
It's not a cat. What is it, then?

218
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,160
It's a polymorph, sir.

219
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,920
A polymorph that's shape shifted
into a felis sapien?

220
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,800
- Precisely.
- That's why the Mercenoid

221
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,560
was flying into that black hole.

222
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,400
It was the only way
he could ensure the polymorph's death.

223
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,200
And we killed the Mercenoid, saved the
polymorph and brought it onboard ship.

And another thing,
according to the black box,

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
the polymorph is carrying eggs.

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Eggs that hatch?

229
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
No, Kinder eggs.

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
Of course eggs that hatch.

231
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
Okay, when will they hatch?

232
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,760
Soon after 'mom' has found a host body
to deposit them in.

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,120
I don't know if I wanna know this
but, um, explain.

All I'm saying is that she had
some moves you'd never even seen.

253
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,400
- Like what?
- Like when you're rolling around

254
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,680
making out,
then the next thing you know,

255
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,880
her big pipe thing
shoots out of her back,

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,440
hovers above you like a crazy snake,

257
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,040
then whooshes straight
down your throat. Woo!

258
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,960
Man, I was like... (GAGS)

259
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,080
Cat, women don't have a big pipe thing.

260
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
Not for you maybe.

261
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,360
But if you drive 'em crazy
by blowing on their antennas...

262
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
What antennas?

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,440
Boom, out it comes.

264
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Then what happened?

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
The usual, she just released her gushy
tadpole stuff down her pipe.

266
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,800
Then afterwards.
she said she'd never been with anyone

267
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
who could hold so many eggs.

268
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,080
I don't know what the hell she meant,

269
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,480
but I think it meant I did good.

270
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,760

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,520
Sir, that wasn't a woman.
It wasn't a felis sapien, sir.

278
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
- It was a shape shifter.
- A what?

279
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,960
It wasn't a cat, it wasn't a woman,

280
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,800
you just had sex with a genetically
engineered insectoid arachnid.

281
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,360
It still counts.

282
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,920
C'mon.

283
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,960
It counts.

284
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
Why doesn't it count?

285
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm counting it.

287
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
she looked a hell of a lot
better last night.

288
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Its life cycle complete, it's died,

289
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,760
as the female polymorph often does

290
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,680
after the exhaustive process

291
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,960
of depositing her morphlings
into a host body.

292
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,360

293
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,880
Sir, we need to get you to the science
room and give you a full medical.

294
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,520
Morphling? What's a morphling?

295
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,880
- We'll tell you later.
- Eh?

296
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,040
When you're securely strapped
to a medi-bed.

297
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Just to explain the ultrasound, sir,

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,280
the probe sends a pulse
through your skin

299
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,560
and into your body,
and the echo bounces back,

300
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,080
which allows us to make sure
that everything is...

301
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
Oh, my God.

302
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,440
Hey, what the hell's happening?

303
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,240
We're just checking, sir.

304
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,480
How many are there?

305
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,880
One, two, three, four.

306
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,960
What about them two? Five, six.

307
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,200
And those down there, seven, eight.

308
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
- We've gotta tell him.
- So tell him.

309
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,240
- Er, better coming from Kryten.
- Why me?

310
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,080
Because you've got
a better bedside manner

311
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,440
when it comes to telling patients
they're raddled with polymorphs.

312
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,840
Hey, hey, what are you saying?
Are you talking about me?

313
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Sir, I have some bad news.

314
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,200
You are pregnant
with eight polymorph eggs.

315
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,240
When they hatch,
they will literally burst out of you

316
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,560
using the nearest orifice available.

317
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,160
You mean rather than forming
an orderly queue?

318
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
What the hell we gonna do?

319
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,880
First, I think it's essential
that you eat something, sir.

320
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,800
You've got to have all your strength
to fight against them.

321
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,200
They're currently depriving your body of
many essential vitamins.

322
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,920
I can't eat at a time like this.

323
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,760
Sir, you must try.

324
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,920
I just want these things out of me.

325
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,560
Have you thought about a caesarean?

326
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,360
- Okay.
- Are you sure?

327
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah, but no croutons.

328
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,920
It's not a salad, you gimboid.

329
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,280
It's an operation where
they laser open your abdomen.

330
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,880
I think it's your only chance
of survival, sir.

331
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Hey, there's no way...
(GROANS IN PAIN)

332
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,680
Thank God
I didn't have that cowardectomy.

333
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,440
We need to sedate him somehow.

334
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,200
Wise words, sir.

335
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,240
Well, at least that's bought us
some time.

336
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,680
We just need to get cleaned up
and do this.

337
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,960
Scalpel.

338
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

339
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,280
Has someone been playing around with
the settings on this thing?

340
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh.

341
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,600
Right. I'm going in.

342
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Hang on, look at the scanner.

343
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,480
The morphlings are going crazy.

344
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,960
What are they turning into?

345
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,800
Tumours. They know we're trying to
extract them early

346
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,040
and they're fighting fire with fire.

347
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,560
We kill them, they kill him.

348
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,000
What do we do?

349
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,560
We have to let them be born
in the normal way.

350
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,360
Do you mean normal as in shooting out of
every orifice simultaneously?

351
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,040
It'll be a bit like me
after a dodgy egg bhuna.

flushing this lot into deep space.
They're so cute.

363

KRYTEN:
Sir, it's their defence mechanism.

364
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,160
They're trying to avoid
being flushed into space.

365
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,040
Look there's a chinchilla
with a pink hat

look at them.

368
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,280

Aw.

371
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,160
Sirs, they are doing this on purpose
to make us feel guilty.

372
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,640
You must remember what they're going to
turn into when they reach maturity.

I mean, most things look adorable
when they're first born,

even velociraptors,
even The Rolling Stones.

375
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,640
- So cute.
- Sir, they're evil genetic mutants.

376
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,520
I should flush 'em.

377
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,320
I got us into this mess,
I should be the one to get us out of it.

378
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Are you sure?

379
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,360
I just wanna have a minute
to say goodbye.

380
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
We'll be just round the corner, sir.

381
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Oh, look at that one. That one is cute.

382
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Sir...

383
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
How long's he gonna be?

384
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,080
He's gone!
Oh, why didn't I anticipate this?

385
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
He's been affected by the oxytocin
hormone released by the morphlings.

386
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,840
- The what?
- It's a hormone

387
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,040
that the morphlings excrete
to ensure their hosts look after them

388
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,600
until they're strong enough to
stand on their own six suckers.

389
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,200
- And then devour his emotions.
- Precisely.

390
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,720
We've gotta find him.

391
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,760
We have to narrow down
the search somehow.

392
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,560
I've got an idea.

393
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Turn off all the heat in the ship
apart from in the diesel decks,

394
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
- so it'll drive him down there.
- And then what?

395
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,120
Track them down undetected.

396
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,040
They are polymorphs, they feed off
emotions, they will sense us.

397
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,840
Not if one of us has got no emotions
as they've had them all removed.

398
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Hey?

399
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,240
Listy, if you have a personality tuck to
remove your emotions, we're sorted.

400
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,680
That stupid tuck machine? Why me?

401
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,120
Kryten's the only one who knows how
to operate it, so I can't be him.

402
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
It can't be me obviously,
that leaves you.

403
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,320
- Why can't it be you?
- Don't interrupt.

404
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,640
Then after the tuck, you'll be able to
walk amongst the morphlings undetected.

405
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,080
They feed on human emotions.

406
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,080
And if you've got no emotions,
they won't know you're there.

407
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,160
And what will happen to my emotions?

408
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,120
We'll just download your brain.

409
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,880
Kryten, have a five-megabyte
memory stick on standby.

410
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,240
Will do, sir.

411
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,680
Oh, I'm not sure about this.

412
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,240
Ah, you're done. Excellent.

413
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,200
I haven't started yet, sir.

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,640
Sorry, I was miles away.

416
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,000
Are you ready, sir?

417
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,000

- Let's send him in then get this done.
- Ah...

420
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
- What?
- Well, according to the tracker,

421
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,120
we are now completely
surrounded by life forms.

422
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,240
Morphlings appear to have reached
full maturation quicker than expected.

423
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,640
But what about the cat?

424
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,800
Does that mean they've already scoffed
all his emotions?

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,760
Well, according to the tracker,
there are nine life forms.

426
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,560
He's still alive, but barely.

427
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,520
Living in an emotionless semi-state,

428
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
his mind almost totally blank.

429
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,840
No change there, then.

430
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,000
But with each polymorph
we eliminate, sir,

431
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,200
part of the Cat's personality
will return.

432
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,200
Hey, buds, I need a hand here.
I'm busted up really bad.

433
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,880
- How did you know that wasn't the Cat?
- I didn't.

434
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,320
- So why did you shoot him?
- Why not?

435
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,440
Help me.

436
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,040
What's wrong with him?

437
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,600
He's got no emotions, sir.

438
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,200
We've turned him into
a dehumanised assassin.

439
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,280
- So what should we do?
- May I suggest, sir, run mode.

440
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Oh, oh, there you are, sir.

441
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,880
I fear Mr Lister may be a polymorph.

442
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
That's how he was able to detect
the other polymorphs and kill them.

443
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,920
Why would he be killing them?

444
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,560
Oh, they're known for
killing each other, sir.

445
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,680
That way there's more food
for the victor.

446
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,720
We can't trust anyone.

447
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
So how can I trust you?

448
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,120
Well, er, how can I trust you?

449
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,880
And how can I trust either of you?

450
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,320
How many are left?

451
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,840
Mmm, make it six.

452
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,240
Six, yeah, that's right.
And he could be one of them.

453
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,920
- I'm not a polymorph.
- Neither am I.

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
Nor me.

455
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,280
What do we do? Why am I asking you?

456
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
Because I'm not a polymorph,
but you might be.

457
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
So might you.

458
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,880
Right, how about we go down
to the science room

459
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,720
and X-ray each other.
That way we can be sure.

460
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,440
Good idea.

This is a nightmare.

463
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,720
For crying out loud,
isn't this hard enough already?

464
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,360
Let's get to the science room
and X-ray one another.

465
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,560
Hey, guys! They had me tied up,
but I got away.

466

What's happening?

467
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,400
There are six polymorphs here
and we don't know who's who.

468
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,160
Ah, I'm sure you'll work it out.
Catch you later. Ow!

470
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,040

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,920
A mamma always knows her kids.

472
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,080
It's me. Can I come in?

473
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,160
I'm trying to sleep, bud.

474
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,040
Cat, I just wanted to talk to you about
that thing that you're not.

475
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,440
I mean, I know you're not, you know
you're not, we both know you're not.

476
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
- Because I'm not.
- Exactly.

477
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,160
But if you were, which you're not,

478
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
it wouldn't mean that you were a loser,

479
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,400
it wouldn't mean that you weren't cool.

480
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,520
It would just mean that you hadn't
met the right girl yet.

481
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,040
- But I'm not.
- Exactly.

482
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,240
- So no need to have this talk.
- Exactly.

483
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,800
- So go away.
- I'm gone.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,240
Man, is he annoying.

485
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,640
So damn patronising.

486
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,160
Don't he know a cat
always has two homes?

487
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,600
I tried to tell him,
but he won't listen.

488
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
Hey, it's late.

489
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,080
We keep talking and there ain't
gonna be much time for loving.

490
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
This is a dream, isn't it?

491
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,120
But look on the bright side,
you haven't woke up yet.

492
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,440
