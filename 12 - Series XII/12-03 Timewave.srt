00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
in an unknown galaxy
on the outer reaches of the solar system

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,840

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
it is only fitting we remember
the generations that came before us.

It is to their memory, their greatness,
their infinite glorious accomplishments,

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,880
that I humbly name this moon "Rimmer".

In the same spirit of benevolence,

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
I've also graciously agreed to lend
my name to the star this moon orbits,

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
which from this moment on,
will be known as "Sunny Rim".

I believe the ship may have been hit

50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,560
by a temporal wash
from a time wave, sir.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,320
It's been what by a what from a what?

52
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,120
Much as a tsunami is caused by a large
displacement of water in the sea bed,

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,880
a time wave is created
by an imploding black hole,

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,360
causing space
time to contort into a series of waves.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,280
Much as a what causes a what
into a series of what's?

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,520
Now, when the wave moves forward,

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,720
artefacts from the past
can be washed up into the present

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
and when the wave withdraws,

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,720
artefacts from the present
can be swept back into the past.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
That sounds like a free ride
out of here. Show me where to stand.

Sir, whoever is hit

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,800
is likely to be swept in
to an uninhabitable part of deep space.

- We'll have to outrun it.

Maybe if we lost some weight.

They're locked on to a crash course

Is Planet Rimmer going to be okay?

The impact is likely
to cause an explosion

79

I've uncovered on the Enconium.

shoved down the toilet

But we've stopped doing that now.

- A whole hour?

In that case you'd better pack earplugs
and six rolls of duct tape.

I wonder why the Enconium
made criticism illegal?

129
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,320
Well, according to their data banks,

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,080
they believe when people criticise,
they feel esteem-inflating superiority

131
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,360
which causes the pleasure chemical,
dopamine, to be released in the brain.

132
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,600
And dopamine's bad?

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Too much dopamine
is like taking cocaine, sir.

134
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,640
It overexcites the receptors
between brain cells,

135
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,760
causing hyperactivity
and engorged self-worth.

136
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,040
So people who criticise
get high on criticism?

137
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
It seems they become addicted,

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,680
needing to criticise more and more
to produce the same original high.

139
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,480

But criticism can be good, can't it?

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,280
I mean, it forces people
to become better.

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
Welcome to our ship.

173
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,400
Now, my name is Ziggy Briceman.

174
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,280
Apologies for not returning
your handshake,

175
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,960
but our communication system
is being repaired

176
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,080
and the hairdressers
who are carrying out the work

177
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,440
haven't quite determined
what's wrong yet.

178
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,400
Oh, also, our lifts are being serviced
by the catering department,

179
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
so therefore to the stairs.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,720
Wouldn't it be better if your lifts were
serviced by the lift service people?

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,040
Oh, unfortunately, they're all too busy
working in the hospital,

182
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,600
trying to figure out
why no one's getting better.

183
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,720
This way, my friends.

184
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,600
I don't know if you're aware,

185
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,360
but you've been washed up
three million years into deep space

186
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,640
and you're on a crash course
straight into a Helium-7 moon.

187
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,080
I love your accent.

188
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,360
It is cuter than a kitten
with a toilet roll.

189
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,400
Now, let me take you along to our diner

190
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,360
and then I'm gonna
hunt down our Captain. Okay?

191
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
This way.

192
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,440
What the hell's he doing?

193
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,160
Best guess, the Enconium crew
are encouraged to express themselves

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,440
without fear of scorn or ridicule.

195
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,080
Bring back scorn and ridicule,
that's what I say.

196
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,280
Sir, please.

197
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,240
Didn't we talk about
respecting other cultures?

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

I love the atmosphere. It's so relaxing.

No one cares if you're right or wrong,
good or bad.

Maybe they're on to something.

205
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,920
I mean, take me, back in the day,

206
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,080
I misrepaired a drive plate
and killed over a thousand people.

207
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,560
Now, in our culture that sort of thing
is really frowned upon.

208
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,600
But here, you just move on.

209

Here's your coffee, sir.
Be careful it's very, very hot.

210

Argh!

Okay, here we are.

216
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
I have one processed sausage
with sprouts in a radish jus,

217
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,360
and one warm goat salad.

218
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,280
We didn't order any food.

219
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240

No, I haven't got a clue. No.

constantly choosing new captains.

326
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,720
So they brought in the anti-criticism
law to make people more tolerant.

But any smegger can see that
society can't function like that.

328

Yeah, but once
they'd outlawed criticism,

329
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,480
nobody could criticise the criticism
law because it was illegal to criticise.

The bridge is that way.
I'll pretend you escaped.

342
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Won't you get in trouble?

343
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
How? Nobody can criticise you here.

344
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,840
Now get going before somebody comes.

345
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,320
Oh, and by the way, you are way too old
to be wearing leather pants.

346
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
Nobody move, please.

347
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,640
Did you help them,
did you betray us, did you?

348
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,920
Yeah, I did, Ziggy.

349
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,360
I betrayed this badge
and made this uniform, quite frankly,

350
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,840
an object of ridicule.

351
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,840
Well, there is no shame
in making mistakes, Officer. You may go.

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,640
To our visitors, we need to drain them.

353
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,280
Now, we are going to drain you
of all your critical faculties

354
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,760
by removing your inner critic.

355
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,720
That little voice in your head that
stops you achieving your full potential.

356
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,520
Now you will no longer
turn down opportunities

357
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,640
for fear of failure or humiliation.

358
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,280
You will only feel love for all things.

359
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,160
They're going to turn us into hippies.

360
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,640
We're going to wind up
like that crazy guy on the flute.

361
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,720
Oh, that was Derek.
He used to be a theatre critic.

362
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,120
Oh, he's come so far.

363
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,440
Look. That's his inner critic.

364
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, my God,
what's he talking to without me?

365
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Whatever it is, he's useless.
He'll fail. He's talentless.

366
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,000
Leave this to me.

367
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,760
As standing acting
Senior Commanding Officer

368
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,320
of the JMC mining ship Red Dwarf,

369
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,600
and protected as I am
under Space Corps Directive 381286...

370
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,840
Kryten, shut up.

371
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,520
I demand that you
release us all immediately.

372
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,960
Or at least one of us
as a gesture of goodwill,

373
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,360
for which I'd like to volunteer.

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,800
My friend, you have nothing to fear.

375
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,440
Happiness awaits
and you shall be the first.

376
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,440
Let's bottle your inner critic.

377
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,760
Now, let your critical observations
flow forth.

378
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,000
You mean, I could end up loving
my parents and admiring my brothers?

379
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,040
You'll have nothing to remain dead for.

380
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,520
Resist, sir, resist.

381
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,520
If they remove your inner critic,
you'll be changed forever.

382
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,320
Changed forever? Listen to him!

383
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,240
My parents were lovely, wise,
thoughtful and supportive.

384
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
Argh!

385
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,600
I achieved all my dreams
and I'm admired and respected.

386
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't fight it. Think of your childhood.
Were you happy?

387
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,040
I was so happy.

388
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,360
I can't hold out much longer.

389
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,760
- (ELECTRICITY BUZZING)
- Argh!

390
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,280
My brother, Howard,
what an utter bastard.

391
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,440
As for my parents,
the schools they sent me to,

392
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,400
the exams I failed
and the support I never got.

393
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,120
And why Yvonne McGruder never wanted
to go on a second date with me.

394
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,040
And my sex life was an absolute shambles

395
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,920
ever since that day at school
my brother gave me sex advice.

396
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,800
He said the most important thing
was the clitoris,

397
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
and I thought what he said
was the most important thing

398
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,760
was to spit on her wrist.

399
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh, the looks I used to get.

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Wait, slow down.

401
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,840
You're criticising faster
than the extractor can cope.

402
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,240
I've hardly started!

403
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,440
Your inner critic's too powerful.
The extractor can't process it.

404
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,200
Well, why can't it process it?

405
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,800
Cheap, damn Minervan, negative energy,
inner critic bottling machines.

406
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
Will you stop criticising?

407
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,040
(EXPLOSIONS)

408
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
What the hell's that?

409
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,080
I'm Rimmer's inner critic.

410
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm the voice inside his head

411
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,680
that reminds him he's an idle,
good-for-nothing, underachieving idiot

412
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,040
who surrounds himself with cretins
to mask his own inadequacies.

413
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,680
He hangs out with other guys besides us?

414
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,080
Tell it to go away.
Tell it to leave me alone.

415
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,560
You need me. I protect you.

416
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,760
Remember the school talent contest?

417
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,680
Twelve years old,

418
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,640
and you wanted to Morris dance
in front of the entire school.

419
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
And you made me chicken out.

420
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,440
We'd have been humiliated.

421
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,320
Same with all those women
I wanted to ask out on dates

422
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,080
you claimed were out of my league.

423
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,520
Of course I did.

424
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,480
Anne Marie was a solid four out of ten.
We're lucky to get threes.

425
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,840
I hate you.
You'd never let me take any risks ever.

426
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,200
I stop you
from making a fool of yourself.

427
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,080
But he's always
making a fool of himself.

428
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,880
Yeah, he is always
making a fool of himself.

429
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,480
So hang on. You're not doing
a very good job, are you?

430
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,840
You can't criticise me.
I'm his inner critic.

431
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,160
Where were you when Rimmer was

432
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,680
fixing that drive plate
and wiped out the crew?

433
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,200
No one criticises me.

434
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,040
Why didn't you tell him
he wasn't up to it?

435
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,880
I mean, aren't you
supposed to protect him?

436
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,720
Well, yes, I suppose I...

437
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,320
So you failed.

438
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,120
Well, that's not fair.

439
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,720
I possibly didn't achieve
all the goals I set out to.

440
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,280
You're right, it failed.

441
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,520
That's a bit strong.
I didn't fully succeed.

442
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,280
- It failed.
- Failed?

443
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,400
- I can't believe you just said that.
- It failed.

444
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
- That's really horrible.
- RIMMER: It failed.

445
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,920
- Is it dead?
- Just wounded.

446
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,840
It'll be back one day. Trust me.

447
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,560
You achieved a positive end
by using criticism to vanquish a foe.

448
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,120
Because you can't tar all criticism
with one brush.

449
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,840
Yes, I see that now.
Perhaps our philosophy is flawed.

450
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,200
Are you criticising your own philosophy?

451
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,200
I suppose I am.

452
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Wait.

453
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Call together all the members
of the High Chamber

454
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,360
and warn them that
I've repealed the law against criticism.

455
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,320
From this moment on, everybody can
criticise without fear of penalty.

456
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Release them.

457
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,080
What about Planet Rimmer?

458
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,080
The ship is on a crash descent course

459
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,960
and your engineering department
don't know what the hell they're doing.

460
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,680
RIMMER: We need to
get to the engine room.

461
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,920
No need, I'll request our engineers
simply return to their jobs

462
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,800
and then we'll be out of here
in a brief contraction of forward space.

463
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,040
I've been racking my brains

464
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,040
as to how I could thank you
for showing me a new way to live.

465
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,280
Now, my first thought
was we could upgrade your mech,

466
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,520
then I thought,
"No, it's not special enough."

467
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,560
Then I thought we could upgrade
Red Dwarf's engine, make it FTL,

468
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,280
but again, I thought,
"No, it's not special enough."

469
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
I wanted to give you
something that would

470
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,680
truly show you
the depth of my gratitude.

471
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,840
For you. It's my finest work.

472
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,680
Don't take this the wrong way, but, um,
it's not that good to be honest.

473
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,640
I repeal the law.

474
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
Critics! I need help here.

475
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,400
Drain them! Drain them all!
