00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,280
Kryten, what are you doing here?

5
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,120
Mechanoids aren't supposed to sit down,

6
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,680
haven't you got duties to complete?

7
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,680
It's my Mechanoid Development programme
this week, sir.

8
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm just waiting for Mr Lister.

9
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,320
We're working
on the human emotion, Patience.

10
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
How long have you been waiting?

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,360
About three hours, sir.

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,000
I think it might be part of the programme.

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
Either that or he's just forgotten.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,520
If I'm honest,
I think he's probably just forgotten.

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,080
What do you want to learn
about patience for?

16
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,440
No one needs patience,

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,240
it's just an excuse for loafing about.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,600
Get on with it, that's what I say,
lickety split.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
- I'll stand in for Lister.
- Sir?

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
I'll teach you about patience,

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
- then you can scoot back to your duties.
- Well, I...

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,200
Are you saying
I can't teach you patience?

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
- No, no.
- Is that it?

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Well, spit it out, man.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,400
I can't hang around
while you're spluttering away

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
like a misfiring Spitfire!

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,240
I just thought Mr Lister might...

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,360
You don't want Lister
to teach you anything

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,720
unless you want to learn
how to be a feckless layabout

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
with the work habits of a stoned sloth.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,880
- Start.
- What?

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
- Start! Jump to it.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,160
Part of Lesson One is to collect
lovely quotations about patience...

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes, yes, yes, get on with it,
wittering on.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
"How poor are they,
that have no patience..."

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Wait, how many quotations are there?

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,360
- Twenty, sir.
- Skip quotations. On to the next.

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,440
- But, sir, we...
- Onwards!

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,760
Section Two says

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,440
- impatience is often caused...
- ...by having too many things to do.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,280
Yes, everyone knows that. Next.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
- It says, lighten your load.
- Faster.

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
- Delegate.
- Obviously.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,520
- Discuss and set homework.
- Already discussed.

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
On to homework.

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,160
But, Sir, we haven't discussed anything.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,640
Yes, we have, you've just forgotten it.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,680

"and give them a task."

Well, get on with it then,
instead of loafing about!

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,040
Well, I'd like to delegate
a task to you, sir.

No, no, we can't skip Mech Dev,

What were we due to work on today?

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,960
(STUTTERING) It was patience, sir.
Remember, we were working on patience.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,800
- It was patience. Patience.
- No, patience was...

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,200
Patience was last week.

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,520
It was manipulation.
You had to manipulate someone,

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
you know, to make them do something

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
they wouldn't ordinar...

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
..ily, do.

How did you get on?

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,200
Up until about ten seconds ago, sir,
I think I was heading for a first.

75

I think I might have left the kettle on.

kind of playing Renegade Monks.

on this too.

through the Cavern of Dark Crystals.

so I can demote you.

onboard the JMC registered mining ship,

127
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,800
I have the privilege to advise that,
you, Third Technician David Lister

128
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
have been promoted.

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,400
Which makes me equal with you
so now, you can't demote me!

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,360
You totally screwed that one up,
didn't you, Rimmer?

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,880
Have been promoted from Third Technician
to Technician 2.5,

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
making you under my authority
by half a command point,

133
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,400
which still gives me the ability
to demote you.

134
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,280
So demote me then, like I care.

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
Maybe I won't demote you.

136
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Of course, you will.

Does your chest jut out that bit more?
Do you feel a little bit taller?

if she knew.

what you're trying to do here, Rimmer.

In that case you'll know all I want

is for you to be the best person
you can be.

and getting fatter.

Hey, that's not fair,
he's not getting fatter.

He's always been this fat.

You think I'm the bad guy in this,
don't you?

148
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,520
But, Lister, you're bright,

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,280
you could go places,
maybe even further than me...

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
Definitely further than you.

to see you fritter it all away.

- Maybe.
- Maybe?

It's not a data stream,
it's a data tsunami.

There's a ship being sucked
into a black hole,

I haven't got a clue,
I thought you'd know.

167
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
I mean, E-cargo,

168
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,800
I presumed, it meant electronic cargo,

169
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,880
you know, data, that was both ey
and cargoey

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,920
and all round, pretty damn useful.

of an SOS virus?

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080

Is that what we were warned about
in basic training?

174
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
I think back then they called it

175
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,560
an SOS virus.

176
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,680
- Is it a bit like that?
- Yes, it's very like that

177

So, it's not E-cargo then?

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,600
Of course, it isn't. That was just
a front to attract the deeply stupid.

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,480
Oh, sir, you didn't stand a chance.

183
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,960
So, what the hell's an SOS virus?

to render the ship inoperable.

- we've got to abandon ship.

it won't break the virus code in time.

194
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,600
Suggest we collect together
all essentials

195
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,520
and then rendezvous, on G Deck,
by the lifts, in ten minutes time.

When we abandon ship with you?

218
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
Incidentally when you pack me I need
Styrofoam and two layers of bubble wrap.

219

And don't forget, shredded paper
round the side,

220

and a this way up sticker.

221

And, use a new box.

if we were taking
the Dispensing Machines with us.

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,600
- Dispensing Machines? Of course not.
- Why?

have combined their processing time
to help the AV software.

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,520
and make a spectacle of you

346
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,840
because I know you'll see my point.

347
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
No, I won't.

348
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
As I said,

349
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,440
because, I know
you'll see my point of view.

350
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,800
Oh!

351
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,280
You know what, thinking about this,

352
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,560
maybe I will work with you,

353
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
working with you will be...

354
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
...cool.

355
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,600
- Cool?
- Sure.

356
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,000
- Him?
- Yeah.

357
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Are you insane?

358
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
He has his good points.

359
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,160
LISTER AND KRYTEN: No, he doesn't.

360
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,760
Plus, he'll win. And when he does,

361
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,320
I'll get a big chunk
of that victory pie.

362
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
RIMMER, LISTER AND KRYTEN:
No, you won't.

363
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,440
I'm still going with Rimsy.

364
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

365
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
We've got to win this.

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,680
Every machine
under Kryten and Lister's control?

367
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
They'll make my life hell.

368
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,880
How are you going to win?
No one likes you.

369
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,480
Especially your running mate.

370
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm going to win
by having the best policies.

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,440
Policies that help
those who need updates

372
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,800
and care for the expired
and the out of warranty.

373
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,560
How you going to achieve all that?

374
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
How do you think? By lying, of course.

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
Rimmer doesn't care about the machines,

376
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,800
he's just doing it for the power
and the glory.

377
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,440
That's how we get him.

378
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
But, I don't understand, sir.

379
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,680
For a start, don't call me "Sir."

380
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Call me Dave.

381
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Or Listy, or Lister.

382
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,200
No, no. Call me Dave.
I'll call you "Sir."

383
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
And, maybe one day,

384
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
- Mr President?
- (SHYLY) Oh!

385
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,360
But, it feels so wrong,
Da... Da... Da... Dave! Oh, I did it!

386
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,120
Your campaign is based on equal rights,

387
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,440
so, it's important that you act equal,

388
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,520
because, well, you are equal.

389
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,040
But I'm not. Oh, I've bitten off
more than I can chew, I just know it.

390
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,400
What are you worried about?

391
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
That you help machines
attain equal rights

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,680
and then one day,
they take over the world?

393
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,000
Sir, take a look around you.

394
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,320
The machines
have already taken over the world.

395
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,640
- Have they? Should I be worried?
- You're asking me?

396
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,840
It strikes me we have a choice.

397
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,960
Get out there, work tirelessly
to understand their needs,

398
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,520
then give them what they want.

399
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I'm sensing an "or."

400
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Or, and maybe easier,

401
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,240
do a massive smear campaign on Kryten.

402
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,480
I'll go slip in to my smear gear.

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,840
My name's Kryten, how do you do?

404
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,760
I'm standing in the coming election

405
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,240
on behalf
of the Independent Future Party.

406
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,960
I've been on G Deck now, all my life

407
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,040
but you hear these stories
about Dispensers coming here

408
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
from P Deck and B deck

409
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,520
because they know
our servicing programs are free.

410
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,960
Before you know it,
they'll be taking over.

411
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,440
How are you going to stop that?

412
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,640
RIMMER: (ON MONITOR) Tonight,
we look at the two contenders,

413
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,600
Statesman and war hero, Arnold J Rimmer,

414
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,280
and Toilet Droid Kryten 2X4B 523P.

415
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
What's this?

416
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,800
A mechanoid is running for election,

417
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
but do the electorate know this droid
has a history of mental illness?

418
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,600
The only survivor on the Nova-5,

419
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,760
he tended a crew of skeletons
believing them to be alive.

420
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,880
He now wants to look after you.

421
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,880
Do you mind he can't tell the difference
between the living and the dead?

422
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,840
(BEEPING)

423
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,600
CAT: (ON MONITOR) You're only as good
as your running mate.

424
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,760
Has anyone taken a close look
at Kryten's number two,

425
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,360
David 'Dodgy Boy" Lister?

426
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
You what?

427
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,080
CAT: A man who served a jail term
in stasis

428
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,280
for smuggling unquarantined animals
aboard a JMC mining ship.

429
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,240
Major questions remain unanswered.

430
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
I hope you're not falling for this.

431
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,160
This commercial
was approved by Arnold J Rimmer.

432
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,640
Right, two can play at this game.

433
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,120
RIMMER: Vote for Rimmer!

434
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,920
Put your pencil
where it'll do most good,

435
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
in my box.

436
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,240
Hello there, little fellas, how are you?

437
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Aren't they adorable?

438
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,200
And what about you, madam,

439
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
how can we best serve you?

440
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
It's my buttons.

441
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,400
on my most popular snacks,
they're worn out.

442
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
Rest assured, if you vote for us

443
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
all Dispensers will have new buttons.

444
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
And, abandon ship situations?

445
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,600
All dispensers will be fitted with feet.

446
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,880
Oh, we'll be able to walk?

447
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
You'll be able to dance.
And, that's a promise.

448
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I like him.

449
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
LISTER: (ON MONITOR) This infomercial comes to you

450
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,480
on behalf
of the Independent Future Party.

451
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,920
Arnold Rimmer, a man who wiped out
the crew of Red Dwarf,

452
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,880
and killed himself twice...

453
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,040
are you really going to put your life
in this maniac's hands?

454
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Arnold Rimmer, not fit not trusted,

455
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,920
a no-good, double-dealing, cheating,
slimy, little smegger.

456
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,800
- That's enough, sir.
- I've got more...

457
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,640
I'm Kryten 2X4B,
and I approve this message.

458
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
I've got more!

459
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,880
They're using a smear campaign
against us

460
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,560
in retaliation to our smear campaign
against them.

461
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
They've sunk as low as us.

462
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,160
That disgusts me!

463
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Wait till the debate.

464
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
That's what it all hinges on.

465
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,320
MODERATOR: Good evening, and welcome
to the party debate.

466
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,520
In the studio tonight,

467
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,120
two leaders with different visions
for our future.

468
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,160
I have a series of questions neither
of the candidates has seen. Let's start.

469
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
First question is for Mr Rimmer.

470
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,560
Mr Rimmer, do you believe
in Silicon Heaven?

471
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,240
Do you believe there is an after-life
for machines?

472
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
You mean, do I believe
there's an actual place,

473
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,040
where the souls of blenders
and photo-copiers

474
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,880
and even calculators go
when they've died.

475
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,040
An actual, real, physical place

476
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,160
where they're somehow reincarnated
and meet their old owners?

477
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes, I do.

478
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,640
Absolutely, yes, yes.

479
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,280
MODERATOR: Question two is for Kryten.

480
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,920
What single change do you think
can improve the life of machines?

481
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,000
I met a dispensing machine the other day
and I asked him what he did

482
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,560
and he said he was a Dispensing Machine,

483
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,560
and I said, "Why?"

484
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,640
And, it turned out he didn't know
he could be anything else.

485
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
He'd never had the opportunity

486
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,560
to break his programming
and become something more.

487
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Believe you me, that is going to change.

488
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
Question for Mr Rimmer.

489
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,960
What's your opinion
on deleting documents?

490
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,440
Do you believe that's murder

491
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,680
or is a document not yet
a fully formed file until it's saved?

492
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,080
That's a good question and one
I'm thrilled you've asked me.

493
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,840
When does a document become a document?

494
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,720
Is it when you type the first word
or when you print it out?

495
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,760
I personally believe

496
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,520
the exact same thing you believe.

497
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,920
That's impressive.

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,040
Come on, bless who he is. I like him.

499
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll tick his box.

500
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,640
You're sure the figures are correct?

501
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,600
According to the focus groups,
we're neck and neck.

502
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
How's that even possible?

503
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,640
A lot of the machines are swallowing
Mr Rimmer's promises

504
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,880
and not believing mine.

505
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,080
There's one swing floor.
The garbage hold. It all rests on that.

506
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
No, not him.

507
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,720
Sir, he could swing the election
in our favour.

508
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,680
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

509
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Not the garbage hold.

510
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,640
There is no alternative.

511
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,680
(DOOR CLOSES SQUEAKILY)

512
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,280
Kryten, don't make me do this.

513
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,080
Sir, there's no other way.

514
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,920
But he's my nemesis.
He's absolutely mental.

515
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,960
All he wants to do is make toast

516
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,840
and if you don't want any,
the little bleeder never stops asking.

517
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,080
We have to turn him on and win his vote.

518
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,120
If it's any consolation, sir,

519
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,720
he's been down here in the garbage hold
for nearly two decades.

520
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,160
I very much doubt he'll be
the same annoying...

521
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,120
Howdy doodly doo! How's it going?

522
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,360
I'm Talkie.

523
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,960
Talkie Toaster,
your chirpy breakfast companion.

524
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,880
Talkie's the name, toasting's the game.

525
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,960
Yeah. The machines
are having an election

526
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,240
and without your vote,
Rimmer might get swept to power

527
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,080
and the whole place will turn to hell.

528
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,880
We want you to vote for me.

529
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
I'm more than happy
to outline my policies.

530
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,880
Before you do, I just have one question.

531
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,320
Don't even go there,
I know the question.

532
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,600
He knows the question.

533
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,200
You know the question.
We all know your question.

534
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,000
Very well, what is it?

535
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
"Would you like some toast?"

536
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,080
No, I'm fine thank you.

537
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,720
Why, would you like some toast?

538
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,440
You've started him off now, sir.

539
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
- No toast.
- How about some brioche?

540
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,760
No brioche. No cornbread,
no yeast bread, no flat bread,

541
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,960
no sweetbread, no fruit bread, no rye,

542
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,000
no soda, no breadsticks, no burger buns, baps
baguettes or bagels,

543
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
no chapati, ciabatta, cracker, crepe
or crumpet,

544
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,360
and definitely no smegging donuts.

545
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,200
Muffins it is. Coming right up.

546
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,760
Sir, we have no choice,

547
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,080
if we're going to win this election,

548
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,440
we're going to have to do a deal
with Talkie.

549
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
(SIGHING) Okay.

550
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,920
- What do you want?
- Well, I want out of the garbage hold.

551
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Fine.

552
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,000
I want to be placed
in the sleeping quarters.

553
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,360
- No way.
- Sir.

554
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Fine.

555
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,080
- Plugged in.
- No...

556
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Fine.

557
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,840
You eat eleven pieces of toast
each morning.

558
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,520
- Three.
- Nine.

559
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,760
- Four.
- Seven and one croissant.

560
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,960
Four and a pan au chocolate.

561
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,160
Six, a bagel and a toasted tea cake.

562
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Fine.

563
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680

What?

574
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,720
To cut a long story short,
I've been reading books.

Before, I couldn't see the writing,
and now I can.

Sir, I fail to see the problem.

They're making me smarter,
I'm learning a whole lot I didn't know.

581
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,560
But, obviously,
I'm not as cool as I used to be.

582
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,040
You've got to make a decision, Cat,
between caring more about being cool

583
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,360
or growing as a person
and becoming smarter.
