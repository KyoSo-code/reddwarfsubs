- What?

176
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,000
- Well, several small fears.
- What?

177
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,920
In fact, more than several fears
and they're not that small.

178
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,600
What?

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,120
For now,
let's restrict it to the largest.

Which is what!

181
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,360
Due to the M-Corp perception software,

182
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,040
all non-M-Corp products
will become invisible to you.

183
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,160
Right.

184
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,480
So what's the most important thing
on board that's not M-Corp?

185
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
Well, can I be frank?

186
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
Of course, just get on with it.

187
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,520
The most important thing on board
that's not M-Corp is me, sir.

189

190

Droids, space craft, light bees

191
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,600
- That doesn't include me does it?
- Well, I'm afraid it does, sir.

192
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
But you just said
the most important thing on board

193
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,280
that was affected by this was you.

194
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
You said I could be frank, sir.

195
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,200
How on earth can you be
more important than me?

- CAT (SILENT) You can't hear me? He can't hear me!
- RIMMER (SILENT) He can't hear you either?

202
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,600

And now I'm the only... (INAUDIBLE) person you can hear...

204
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
I can't hear you either now, Kryten.
What do I do? How do I fix this?

205
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,000

229
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,840
They bought Earth
in the late 26th century.

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,280
Bought Earth? Bought what exactly?

231
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,040
They bought the entire planet, sir.

232
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
And everything on it.
Including fixtures and fittings.

233
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,720
Oceans, countries, animals, houses,
curtains, you name it.

234
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,680
They even bought
all the stuff no one likes.

even the American chocolate.

Even the rain water.

239
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,640

And the Earth dudes
just stood around and let this happen?

243
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, by then, M-Corp had
introduced a law to tax thinking.

244
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
A Think Tax?

245
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,960
You'd have got a rebate every year.

the brain consumed, firing neurons

247
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,520
and charged accordingly.

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,360
As the brain requires electrical charges
to do practically anything,

250

no one could afford
the thinking time to fight back.

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,840
We've got to get rid of
the M-Corp update

to get rid of us by making us invisible.

If we can access the ship's mainframe,

255
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,120
we may be able to reboot Red Dwarf
back to its factory settings.

We take one of your backup drives,
before the new software was loaded,

262

then reload you back onto
the system when we reboot.

At present you don't have enough credits

and then buy early release.

Here we go.

325
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,560

when you set up the system.

"Who did you share
your first kiss with?"

333
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,840
I'll type this: "Uncle Frank".

334
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,320
Kryten, that was personal.

335
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,920
It was a special moment,

336
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,000
I had no wish to share it with
the rest of world, if you don't mind.

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,120
You already told us this story.

338
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,440
The dude snuck into your bedroom
because he thought you were your mama.

339
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,720
I was asleep, okay.
Now if you don't mind, can I get on?

340
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,080
Is that what he said?

341
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
Sir, when you set
the security question up,

342
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,280
why didn't you simply put
in the name of your first love?

343
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
The questions are
supposed to be obscure,

344
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,680
so it's hard for anyone
to break in and get inside.

345
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,360
Unlike your kissing lips.

346
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,560
Ah. We did it.

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,000
Red Dwarf is about to reboot.

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
What happened? Where are we?

351
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,240
Sir, you've rebooted
from your safety file.

352
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
You've missed the last month.

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I did? What happened?

354
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
I beat you at poker this morning
and you agreed to be my slave for a day.

355
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,960
The rest, he'll fill you in.

356
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,680
Come on, Mr Lister should be
able to see us now.

357
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,720
There's no way I'm buying anything
off you guys. Ever.

Would you like to buy
some pain pills, Dave?

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,640
No. (YELPS)

361
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,000
We can dock it directly
from your account.

362
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,920
All right, fine. Quick.

364
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,160
Water. I need a glass of water.

365
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,640
That will be 40 dollar-pounds, Dave.

366
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
For water?

367
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
For the glass.

368
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,480
The water is a further
400 dollar-pounds.

369
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,680
- I'll pay now.

370
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,600
You caused that pain somehow,
didn't you?

371
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,480
Well, that's it.
I'm not buying anything else.

372
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,520
Whoa. Fire.

373
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,360
Where's the fire extinguisher?

374
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,520
If you're in need of
a fire extinguisher, you're in luck,

375
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,680
because for a limited time only,

376
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
we're having a sale
on fire extinguishers.

377
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,920
They're currently
just 600 dollar-pounds.

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,960
No, I'm not buying one!

- (FIRE INTENSIFIES)
- Okay, I am buying one!

380
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm not taking a stand.

381
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,280
For an additional payment
would you like to purchase

382
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
insurance for
your fire extinguisher, Dave?

383
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,880
Yeah. Fine. Whatever! Just give me
the smegging extinguisher!

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,160
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

(INAUDIBLE) I'll buy more words.

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
You'd like to buy more words?

392
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,400
How many words
would you like to buy, Dave?

393
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
(INAUDIBLE) Seven thousand.

394
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,920
You've run out of credits, Dave.

395
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,680
So now, we remove time
from your lifeline.

(INAUDIBLE) My what?

397
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,960
You charge in time?

398
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
Why do you charge in time?

399
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,720
Everything costs time, Dave.

400
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,400
It's the most valuable commodity
in the universe.

401
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
I've got older again. Why?

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,480
That's the charge for my guidance, Dave.

403
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,720
As you've no longer got any credits,

404
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,640
I now charge you, in life.

405
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
Mr Lister, sir!

406
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,200
He's not here. Where the hell's he gone?

407
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
It looks like he used this teleporter.

408
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
We've got to track him down.

409
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,680
How? He could be anywhere.

410
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Well, if I can repair Chippy's computer,

411
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,800
we might be able to re-establish contact

412
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,440
with the implant
that's inside Mr Lister's body.

413
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,440
- And track that down?
- Precisely.

414
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,760
All repaired.

415
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm getting a signal
but his lifeline is very weak.

416
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,080

424
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,360
So Lister bought all this stuff?

425
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,840
How? Where's he got the dough?

(EXCLAIMS) It's Mr Lister!

They've charged him in time.
We've got to get him out of here.

He still can't see or hear us.

429
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,360
Let's get him to the teleporter.

430
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey, what's going on? Why am I moving?

431
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,720
Welcome to M-Corp. A pay-per-life
virtual integrated environment.

- Are you sure?
- Yes.

There's nothing I can sell you?
How about a sound system?

435
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,440
- ALL: No!
- I'd love one.

436
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,160
How about a lightweight,
hydro mop steam cleaner?

437
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
ALL: No.

438
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
Okay. I'll have one of them, too.

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,880

We're never gonna get out of here.

00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,120
Wait, I have it.

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,440
Excuse me, miss.

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,040
We'd like to buy a malicious virus

for shopping with M-Corp.

Mr Lister?

451
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,960
He still can't see or hear us.

452
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,360
Let's get him back to Red Dwarf.

453
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,720
What's going on guys? Is this you?

454
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,800
This doesn't make sense.

455
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,320
We're no longer running
the M-Corp software.

456
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
We've rebooted the ship.
Why can't he see or hear us?

457
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,680
I still can't see or hear you.

458
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
So if this thing ain't in the ship,
where is it?

459
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,880
Unless of course it's not the ship
that contains the M-Corp software,

460
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
it's in Mr Lister.

461
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,760
The perception software didn't hack
Red Dwarf. It hacked Lister's brain.

462
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
So lemme get this straight.

463
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,520
Are you saying Dreadlock Dave's
got some kind of virus in his head.

464
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
If so, how come I didn't catch it?

465
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
Perhaps it needs
more than two bytes of RAM.

466
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,600
So what we gonna do?

467
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,120
To get rid of the virus,
we have to treat Mr Lister's brain

468
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,360
in the same way we'd treat
a corrupted computer.

469
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,520
We have to delete everything
and reinstall new files.

470
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,920
Perhaps if I patch through to Chippy,

471
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
we can communicate with him
on a different frequency.

472
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320

Sir, we need to reinstall
your personality.

It's the only way
to rid your brain of this virus.

Where are we gonna get
my personality from?

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,160

any single crew member

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
back as a hologram.

480
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,000
According to the logs, sir, your last
file save was when you were 23.

481
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,800
Are you saying, I'm going to lose
everything I've learned

482
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,480
and go back to being 23?

483
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,640
That whole wealth of wisdom
and knowledge and experience

484
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,760
will go down the flusher?

485
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,520
Don't worry bud, give us a few minutes,
we'll fill you in.

486
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,520
Perhaps I can rebuild your full profile

based on CCTV recordings.

488
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,760

to get you fully restored.
