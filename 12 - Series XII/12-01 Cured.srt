00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,600
CAT: OK, five card draw poker.

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,600
You in, Cincinnati?

4
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,880
Of course he's in. Come on, Rimmer.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Deal the cards.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,440
RIMMER: Match-sticks, nothing more.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,640
If you think you're winning
my back issues

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,080
of Morris Dancer Monthly,
you've got another thing coming.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,520
Here we go.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
One, two, three, four, five.

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,480
Let's see what we got.

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,560
Where are our cards?

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,840
You ain't getting any.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,320
- But without cards, we can't win.
- Exactly!

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,600
What kind of game is that?

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,960
A good game.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,200
A game I'm gonna win.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Look, let's try it another way.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,840
So that we all get

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,240
five cards

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,800
and we all get

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,280
a chance to win.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,080
You might just enjoy it.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,560
How many cards do you wanna change?

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,160
None, are you crazy?

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,680
You've got a really good hand, right?

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
How did you know?

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,640
Have you never heard of a poker face?

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Huh?

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,960
You get your cards,
you look at 'em like this,

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
and you don't give anything away.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,240
All right. Let try it again.

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
How many cards do you want to change?

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,400
Five.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
(BEEPING)

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,240
KRYTEN: Sirs, we're picking up an SSL.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
It's in the neighbouring vector.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,160
OK, starting her up.

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,040
(ENGINE STARTING)

40
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,400
Silky as the first day we got her.

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,560
Moon base, coming up
on our starboard side.

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
What is this place, Kryts?

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
According to the ident,

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,440
it's a United America Scientific
Research Station.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
- United America, who's that?
- Well, at the end of the 23rd century,

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,080
America attempted
to bring peace to the world,

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,080
by asking every nation on Earth

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,040
to sign a Peace Treaty.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,720
Any nation that refused, they invaded.

50
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
Now a war ensued

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,160
that was called the War against War.

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Those countries who went to war,

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,640
because they were so against war,

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,200
they were prepared to go to war,

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
to fight in a war against war,

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,760
called themselves, United America.

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,840
But why would
these United America johnnies

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,160
want to build a Research Station
way out here?

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,520
By the looks of their manifest,
their loaded with tech,

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,800
maybe we can finally fix
Starbug's thruster.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm sick of always having to turn left.

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,440
Alrighty. Bringing her in.

63
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,800
RIMMER: There's a sandstorm coming in.
18 on the Newton scale.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
Looks like we're going
to be stuck here for a while.

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
Any idea what they did here, Krytes?

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, it appears they were testing
a cure for evil, sir.

67
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Evil? But you can't cure evil.
That's ridiculous.

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,040
What do they do?
Hand out tubes of evil ointment?

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,200
"Gently rub into your frontal lobes
when feeling psychotic."

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
To be honest,
I've never really believed in evil.

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,760
You should try inhaling
your socks, sometimes.

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,120
LISTER: OK.

73
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,680
Some people do terrible things,
but not because they're evil,

74
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,600
it's because they're mentally bonkers.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,560
I never realized you read up
on the subject, Listy.

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,560
'Mentally bonkers' I'm struggling
a bit to keep up here.

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
Do you mean they're psychopaths?

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Well, not all psychopaths kill
of course, sir.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,000
They don't?

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,400
Most psychopaths lack empathy for others

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
and have no remorse.

82
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,600
But as a rule, they don't actually
physically harm anyone.

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,400
- So what do they do then?
- Well, many go into banking.

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,840
Many others are CEOs, businessmen,
lawyers, even politicians.

85
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,040
Ruthless men and women,
drawn to positions of power

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
and the reward that brings.

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,040
This evil cure, Krytie,
any idea who they test it on?

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,880
You think they might be wall to wall
crazies in here?

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,560
Running around, rioting,
screaming and stabbing people?

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,400
You make it sound like my old school.

91
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,680
I want all of the bazookoids,
safety's off, ready to fire.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,080
All of the bazookoids are back
on Red Dwarf sir.

93
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,720
(EXHALES) Have we got any guns with us?

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
Just your staple gun, sir.

95
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,320
Fill her up.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,040
Hey.

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,720
Cryo booths.

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
Look at this.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,920
'Vlad the Impaler: Cured.'

100
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
'Joseph Stalin: Cured.'

101
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
'Messalina: Cured.'

102
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,440
'Adolf Hitler: Cured.'

103
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
'Rupert Murdoch:

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,000
'not responding to treatment.'

105
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Hitler?

106
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,240
Isn't he dead?

107
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
I thought he died playing golf.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,360
He was in Berlin, you goit, in a bunker.

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,360
He poisoned his partner
and shot himself.

110
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,160
Huh. Golf can do that to you.

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,440
All these people
are from ancient history.

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
Where did they get them from?

113
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,760
It appears they tracked down
their descendants,

114
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,680
and then,
with DNA regression technology,

115
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,320
travelled back, down the ancestral line

116
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
via their mitochondrial DNA,

117
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,360
and recreated them.

118
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
But Hitler didn't have any kids.

119
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
His ancestral line died with him.

120
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,040
I read this conspiracy book once,

121
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,120
and it proposed the theory that
at the end of the second World War,

122
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,200
Hitler killed his wife
and his body double,

123
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,080
to make it look as if
he committed suicide.

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,320
Then, he snuck off to Argentina
in a stolen U-boat,

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,040
with art treasures looted
from the museums of Europe.

126
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,040
Hitler... the more you hear about that guy(!)

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,960
The story went,
that when he reached Argentina,

128
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
he had kids there.

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,760
Well, there's a long held belief that
memories are indeed encoded

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,120
in DNA, sir,
and passed down the ancestral line.

131
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,080
It explains why humans have

132
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,280
seemingly inexplicable phobias.

133
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
- Like?
- Fear of rats, for example.

134
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,640
Fear of rats. Descendants beware,

135
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,720
- they spread bubonic plague.
- Precisely.

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,160
Fear of clowns?

137
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,800
Descendants beware, of weird looking
children's entertainers.

138
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,040
They can be really dodgy.

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,560
So who's this Messalina?

140
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,920
The third wife
of the Roman Emperor, Claudius.

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,760
Possibly the most depraved,

142
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,680
brutal and murderous nymphomaniac
in history.

143
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,200
Not all bad, then.

144
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,120
These are some of the most damaged
and deranged humans who ever lived.

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
They are worse than
the 1970s Leeds United team.

146
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,960
So how do they cure these people?

147
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
In people labelled 'evil,'

148
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,480
a misfiring gene,

149
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
has often turned empathy off.

150
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,160
So they can just flick it back
on like a light switch?

151
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,280
It's as easy as that?

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,080
Hey, light switches can be tricky.

153
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,760
I don't always get them first time.

154
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
There's another cryo booth here.

155
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,000
Professor Shaul Telford.
Maybe he can help us.

156
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,080
KRYTEN: I suggest we release
the Professor

157
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,520
and ask him if they have the tech here,
to repair the thruster.

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,280
Hey, this one's empty.

159
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,320
TELFORD: Indeed it is.

160
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
Good day, gentlemen.

161
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Your arrival here
automatically triggered

162
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,840
the cryo booths to release mode.

163
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
Wait, when you said, we automatically
triggered the cryo booths,

164
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,920
did you mean, all the cryo booths?

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You have nothing to fear.

166
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
My patients have been cured
for many centuries.

167
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,760
Come.

168
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,480
Join us for lunch.

169
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,280
Let me introduce you. Joseph Stalin.

170
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,520
Privyet. Call me Joe. (LAUGHS)

171
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,600
- Adolf Hitler.
- Please, call me, Dolphy.

172
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,800
No Mein Fuhrers, that's the old me.

173
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
- Messalina.
- Call me, uh,

174
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
anytime.

175
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,760
(STALIN, HITLER LAUGHING)

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,480
HITLER: She is such a joker.

177
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
It is so lovely for us to have guests.

178
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Some wine? Let me be Mutter.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,240
Now, appetizers?

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,960
Pumpernickel canapés? We just got them
out of cryo. I made them myself.

181
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,680
Dragonfruit?

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
That's a keeper.

183
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,840
Oh, and you must try his puddings.

Oh, Messie, please,
you're embarrassing me.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,160
She's terrible.

(LAUGHING)

188
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
Oh, sorry, I'm late.

189
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,320
- May I sit here?
- Sure.

190
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm Vlad. The Impaler.

191
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,120
Ah. Are you on your own
or is there a Mrs. The Impaler?

192
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
What about all the other scientists?

193
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,960
I mean, surely you weren't
here on your own.

194
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,480
Well many years ago they sent
a Special Task Force to eliminate us.

195
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,640
But with our pooled skills,
we managed to survive.

196
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Why would they try to eliminate you?

197
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
A cure for evil would mean
an end to War.

198
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
An end to war would mean
no Arms industry.

199
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,360
Which would mean, trillions of lost
dollar-pounds.

200
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,160
The First World economy would slump.

201
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
The Second and Third world economy
would boom.

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
There would be no one to exploit.

203
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
Society wouldn't work any more.

204
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,880
Yes, they couldn't allow
the end of evil to happen.

205
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,200
So they marooned us here,

206
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,960
with no hope of getting back to Earth.

207
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,680
But enough. Let us eat.

208
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
There's much to do.

209
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,160
After lunch, we must show you
our engineering department.

210
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,480
In the meantime, a toast.

211
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,760
To new friends.

212
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
ALL: New friends.

213
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000

but I just totally adore your jacket.

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,840

on Mimas, and then I painted it myself.

of the palette is dazzling.

Well, I applied
but they wouldn't take me.

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,880

Look I can't jam with you, OK?

248
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,400
It's because I'm Hitler, isn't it?

249
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,880
Look, I admit I was evil.

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,720

Really, I am.

of a chance to talk at lunch

Don't even think about it, lady.

I know all about your murderous,
poisoning, nympho-seducing ways,

260
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
so let me tell you right now.

261
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,600
This, is off limits.

262
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,600
- All right.
- I know this is gonna be hell for you.

Like dangling the world's juiciest steak
in front of a starving pitbull.

264
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,560
But you're just gonna have
to accept the fact

265
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,040
that no matter how much you want it

266
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,560
you ain't getting it. Got it?

267
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
That's fine.

268
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040

which means I may be bending down a lot.

269
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,280
I might even get sweaty and have to pop
of my shirt. Now if that happens,

270
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,840
I suggest you fashion some sort of bib,
to catch the drool.

Otherwise, we're gonna be slipping
and sliding all over the place

Look, you do not need to worry because
I'm really not interested in you.

273
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
- You're not interested?
- No.

around three in the morning.

336
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
So you're suggesting that
we just walk away from here

337
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,560
and leave them to die?

338
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,280
No. I'm suggesting we leg it from here
and leave them to die.

That's not right. Cured or not cured.

- Apart from Telford.

Well, he won't go without everyone else.

344
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,920
Well, then, we'll leave him too.

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,560
In fact, let's leave him too.

we're no better than they were.

drugged, sir?

454

mean that it is mine.

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
to anyone but himself. Join me.

530
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,640
I don't care what the damn scan says

531
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,920
we're the Posse.

532
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,680
- Boys from the Dwarf.
- Yeah.

533
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,360
- No one's changing sides here.
- Nuh-uh.

534
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,160
And I'll give you anything
that you want.

535
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,360
Sounds good.

536
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,200
- Cat, man?
- Hey, I'm a cat.

537
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,840
It's my nature.

538
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,960
I can't help it. You heard him.

539
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,480
- I have no fidelity.
- Well, in that case, sir,

540
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,560
- Why be on his side? Be on ours.
- Okay.

541
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,120
I'll give you anything
that your heart desires,

542
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,080
if you join me and show me
how the ship starts.

543
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,360
Okay, deal.

544
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,320
I'll give you anything
that your heart desires,

545
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,040
plus, a special secret surprise,

546
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,600
if you join us?

547
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,040
I love secret surprises.

548
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,800
They're not going to be giving
you anything because pretty soon,

549
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,160
they're gonna be dead.

550
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,400
In fact, let me prove it to you
by killing them

551
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,720
- one by one.
- No, wait.

552
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,680
I'm with you. But I get to do it.

553
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,760
Hmm?

554
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,240
Can I trust you?

555
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,160
Can I?

556
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
Really?

557
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm a psychopath, ain't I?

558
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,160
You and me, both.

559
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
What more do you need?

560
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,480
(SHOOTS)

561
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,560
I'm starving. Let's eat.

562
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,200
You shot him.

563
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,680
How was that for a pokey face, huh?

564
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,760
It's poker face.

565
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,160
I only have to know how to do it,
not say it.

566
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,656
# It's cold outside,

567
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,216
# There's no kind of atmosphere,

568
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,976
# I'm all alone,

569
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,120
# More or less,

570
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,296
# Let me fly,

571
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,920
# Far away from here,

572
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,520
# Fun, fun, fun,

573
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,320
# In the sun, sun, sun.

574
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,256
# I want to lie,

575
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,936
# Shipwrecked and comatose,

576
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,440
# Drinking fresh

577
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,640
# mango juice,

578
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,933
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

579
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,176
# Fun, fun, fun,

580
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,880
# In the sun, sun, sun,

581
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,640
# Fun, fun, fun,

582
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,880
# In the sun, sun, sun.
