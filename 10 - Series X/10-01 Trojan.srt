1
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,120
Ow! Yeah!

2
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,160
- (RACING COMMENTARY)
- Hey, budski!

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,400
All right, man? Just watching the racing.
I've got a bet on with dispenser 55.

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,080
Come on, Golden Boy, you big lump.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,880
Golders! There we go!
Come on, you're winning by a snout!

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,840
That's the lad! Come on,
you fine thing, you! Here we go!

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,120
- (RACING COMMENTARY)
- God!

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,440
You lazy fat pig.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,720
That's 100 dollar-pounds
down the crapper.

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,600
Pigs racing.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
Hey! What's this?

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
Found that in Petersen's quarters.
There's some crazy stuff in that, man.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,200
For instance, did you know
that in the 1970s in Sweden,

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
20% of all traffic accidents
involved a moose?

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
- A moose?
- It's crazy, that, isn't it?

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Well, if they're stupid enough to let 'em
drive, what the hell do they expect?

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,320
- The moose aren't driving.
- You just said they were.

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,760
No, they're not driving.
They're just causing the accidents.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,360
You mean they're in the back
fooling around, distracting the driver?

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,240
That is insane.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
Why are they giving them a lift
in the first place?

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,480
Let 'em walk! They got legs!

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
No, the moose aren't in the cars,
antlers out the sunroof.

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,120
They're in the roads, moosing about,
crossing roads, causing accidents.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,760
You mean they're not looking
left and right?

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,840
Exactly.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,160
- Not using the pedestrian crossings?
- Exactly.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Not paying attention to whether it's
a little green man or a little red man?

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,920
Of course they're not!
They're mooses! Eesh.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,960
These Swedes, they expect too much.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,480
- Ah, Kryten.
- Mail, sir, internal.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,480
Excellent. I resat my astronavs.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,920
Again, sir? Is that wise?

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,560
I want to be an officer, Kryten.
I can't help myself.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,720
I've always loved leading.
Being a leader, doing leadery things.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,560
- Bossing people about, sir?
- Exactly.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,360
But aren't you concerned,
though, sir, if you fail,

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
you'll spend another weekend
sobbing inside a cupboard?

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,680
I've only failed nine times, Kryten.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,000
You make me sound like
a complete halfwit. Here we go.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
Good luck, sir.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Good luck not required,
you metal munchkin.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Because, and here's the clever bit,
I expect to fail.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,920
You do, sir?

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,600
Absolutely, Kryten.
It's a fiendishly difficult paper.

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,120
And I've decided
not to be so hard on myself.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
If I pass, splendissimo.

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,040
If I fail, hey-ho, pip and dandy.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,040
That's my new life slogan.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,680
Oh. Hey-ho, pip and what, sir?

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,160
Sometimes you have to learn how to lose
before you're ready to win.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,480
It's all in this fascinating book
I'm reading.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
Oh, what's it called, sir?

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,800
Sometimes You Have To Learn How
To Lose Before You're Ready To Win.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,760
It's not a long book, Kryten, but it makes
a good point, I think, which is...

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Sometimes you have to learn how to lose
before you're ready to win.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,680
You've read it?

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,520
Er... actually, no, I haven't, sir.

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,560
Ah, sounds like you have. Anyway!

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
The point is, after reading it,

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm much more forgiving
of my little faults and failures.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,880
Whatever the result,
I shall accept it with calm equilibrium.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Hey-ho, pip and dandy, sir!

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
Exactly.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,720
Can you never, ever succeed at anything?!

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,480
You useless rancid cancerous sack of sick!

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm guessing this is a hey-ho,
pip and dandy moment, sir.

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,440
COMPUTER: Your craft
has just entered the catchment area

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
for the All-Droid Mail Order
Shopping Station.

70
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,080
- Hey, what's this?
- Welcome to All-Droid,

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,280
where shopping's made easy.

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,480
That is totally astonishing!
Talk me through this, Bob.

73
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,480
Oh, these shopping channel ads
are just so lame.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
You simply put your sugar
into your coffee like so,

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,920
place it in the housing unit....

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
Who buys this junk?

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,560
...grab your Stirmaster, and
the Stirmaster stirs your coffee for you!

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Golly! Even I could do that!

79
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,280
- Who'd want that?
- It's totally junk.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,520
The average person who lives to their 90s,
and has six cups of coffee a day,

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,640
spends over two weeks stirring drinks!

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,560
- Oh, my!
- Two weeks?

83
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,920
Two weeks?

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,960
Think what you could do in that time.

85
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,560
Two weeks stirring, or two weeks skiing?

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,160
- I know what I'd rather do!
- Ha-ha! Me too!

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,880
The Stirmaster.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,920
A lovely addition to any modern kitchen.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,200
Buy yours now!

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,520
I want one. What about you?

91
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,320
I'd like to order a Stirmaster, please.

92
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Two. Make it two.

Sirs? The scouters
have located a derelict.

97
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,760
- I'm getting a Stirmaster.
- I'm getting one too.

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,960
Have you seen this about mooses?

99

(WHIRRING AND BEEPING)

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,040
Hey, nice ship.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,960
A Quantum Twister, Listy.
The pride of the Space Corps.

105
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
My three brothers
served on ships like this.

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I had no idea, sir.
What were they, waiters or barmen?

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,680
Captains, Kryten.

108
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
Proud Fellows of the Space Corps
Super-Infinity Fleet.

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,720
And your brothers have the same genes
as you? That's impressive.

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,240
It's like a pole-vaulter winning gold
with a chopstick.

111
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,840
It must make you so proud, though, sir,

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,840
knowing that your brothers
served on ships like this.

113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,040
Must give you a warm glow in your heart.

114
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,760
Yes, it's called heartburn, Kryten.

115
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,760
I also get palpitations and nausea.

116
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,280
How can you be jealous?
Those Space Corps jocks were all jerks.

117
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,760
Just a load of overprivileged,
practical-joke-playing party boys.

118
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,080
Party boys? They were space marines,
Listey, ripped and pipped.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,680
Do you know what their slogan is?

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,720
"While you sleep,
we're probably saving the universe."

121
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,520
You sure? I thought it was,
"While you sleep,

122
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,800
"we're probably shaving off your pubes
and gluing them to your head."

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
Hey, maybe we could swap ships.

124
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,920
This baby's got to be better
than Red Dwarf.

125
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,680
That crate's slower
than the speed of dark.

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,680
Unfortunately impossible, sir.
The Trojan is not flight-worthy.

127
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,680
There must be 40 buttons here,
all for the captain only,

128
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,160
his special private captainy buttons.

129
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,520
40!

130
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,320
This could have been mine. Why could
I never pass my damned astronavs?

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,160
Those Space Corps boys had everything.
The buttons, the blasters,

132
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,640
the snug elasticated jumpsuits.
They had it all!

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,640
CAT: Did you see that?

134
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,880
That was cool!

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160

My Light Bee must have glitched.

- Welcome to All-Droid.

139
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,000
Hello? Yeah, still here. Still holding.

140

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,280
Don't forget me! I want one too!

142
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,880
This ship's got everything.
It's light years ahead of Red Dwarf.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
It's even got one of these.

144
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,280
A greeny glowy thing.

145
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,080
Mm. Sir. That is a quantum rod, sir.

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,280
It acts like a magnet,
allowing the ship to star-jump.

147
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Does it? How?

148
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, quite simply, sir, it draws things
formerly connected back together,

149
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,160
and as everything is made of energy, and
all energy was present at the big bang,

150
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,200
then everything is connected.

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,240
So the rod reconnects things
light years apart,

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,120
allowing the ship to contract space/time.

153
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
Kryten, you have a real gift.

154
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,360
You make things that are
really, really complicated

155
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,400
sound really, really complicated.

156
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,240
It is a little sensitive, sir.

157
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,400
You should put it back.

158
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah.

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
What's happening to the chair?

171
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
I think that one is the comm switch, sir.

172
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
Why couldn't they mark it more clearly?

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,920
Someone could look a real idiot
doing that.

174
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,960
This is Columbus 3. Come in.
Do you copy? Over.

175
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,320
- We need help, and fast. Over.
- Go, Columbus. Over.

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Crew dead. Main drive fragmenting.

177
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,440
- Do you copy? Over.
- Affirmative. Over.

This is Ship Hologram Howard Rimmer.

181
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Can you help us? Over.

182
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,000
What? Over.

183
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,280
Your brother, sir! What are the chances?
It's extraordinary. Did the rod do this?

184
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,320
Ship Hologram Howard Rimmer.
Can you help? Over.

185
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,320
I can't meet him. How can I meet him?
He's a captain, I'm a nobody.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,320
A vending-machine repair man. I can't
save his life, it's too embarrassing!

187
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
Trojan, confirm coordinates received.
Over.

188
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,080
Er...received. Over.
Sir, shall I prepare the teleporters?

189
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,120
I've got 15 hours to pass my astronavs,
become his equal. Then I can save him.

190
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,680
Columbus, we're on our way.
We'll be there in 15 hours. Over.

191
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,320
But, sir, we could be there
in a matter of seconds.

192
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,760
Kryten, as your superior officer,

193
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
I order you to erase
the last five minutes of your memory.

194
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,760
But, sir, that contravenes
my rights of service.

195
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,360
In which case, I also order you

196
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,400
to erase the memory of the order
I just gave you to erase it.

197

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,480

200
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,200
Lister, will you turn that damn thing off?
I'm trying to revise.

201
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm getting that Stirmaster, Rimmer.
I'm not hanging up this phone.

202
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,280
It goes everywhere with me.
The loo, the bath, you name it.

203
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,200
If Kochanski walks through that door now
and wants sex,

204
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,560
I'll wedge it in me bum crack
and get to work.

205
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
I am not hanging up the phone.

206
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,520
Oh, a lateral thinking question.
I've never been good at these.

207
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,520
Come on, then. Come on, hit me.

208
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,320
Right, it's 1971.

209
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,720
A Swedish man crashes into a tree.

210
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,880
What causes the accident?

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,440
It's nothing medical.
Nothing wrong with the car.

212
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,840
Right, so, um... Swedish guy drives
into a tree. What caused the accident?

213
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,840
- Answer's in the back, right?
- Right.

214
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,160
Wow. It's a really hard one, that.

215
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,720
I mean, you've probably
got to be pretty damn smart

216
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,720
to get a question like that right.

217
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
You know what? I'm gonna go for a moose.

218
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,360
A moose? (SCOFFS)

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,240
Yeah, it was in the road.
He swerved to avoid the moose.

220
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,960
Are you insane? How can it be a...?

221
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,800
It's a moose.

222
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,800
Sometimes life is good.

223
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Ah, sir, you asked me to remind you
it's ten minutes to your exam.

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,280
Ah. Kryten, a lateral thinking question.
Just got it myself.

225
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,760
It's 1971.

226
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,200
A Swedish man drives into a tree.
What causes the accident?

227
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,480
It's a moose, sir.
He swerves and hits a tree.

228
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,760
Is it me? How did you get that?

229
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,240
- Get what?
- I've got something for you.

230
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,760
- A lateral thinking question.
- A lottery what?

231
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,760
Ah, I knew I could rely on you.

232
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,600
What caused this accident?

233
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,440
What accident?

234
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,120
No, it's a question, all right?
Are you ready?

235
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,960
It's 1971. A man...

236
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,280
Was he Swedish?

237
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,440
- Yes.
- A moose.

238
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
It was a moose.

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,600
He swerved to avoid it and hit a tree.

240
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh, the moose is on the road,
by the way, not in the car driving.

241
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,280
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

242
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,280
Who am I kidding?
I'm never gonna pass this exam.

243
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
It's so unfair!

LISTER: Look at his eyes.

245
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,680
They're spinning beach balls of doom.
His hard disk must have crashed.

246
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,120
Mmm. He's completely helpless.
What are we going to do?

247
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,400
I say we draw a moustache on him.

248
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
What?
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

249
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
Then we fix him.

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,920
But first, get out the felt-tips.

251
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,880
- Who's this?
- Oh, look, you can't do this.

- You got who it is yet?
- Oh, look, this is so wrong.

254
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,040
You can't do this. It's so... it's so...

- How long have I been out?

00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,360
Three hours.

259
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,360
It took longer than we thought
to rub off the felt-tip.

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,600
What happened?

261
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,600
Well, sir, your hard drive was overrun
by a form of self-created malware, sir -

262
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,240
millions of unnecessary memory files
clogging up your system.

263
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,880
The average person
has 3,000 different thoughts a day.

264
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,080
He only has three.

265
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,920
But of your thoughts, over 60% were
you obsessing about past resentments.

266
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,640
Your brothers' success, your career
failure, your death, your lousy sex life.

267
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Over the years, your system has become
so engorged with resentment,

268
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,520
you've had a massive data jam.

269
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,960
Are you saying I'm a resentful person?

270
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
I really resent that.

271
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,520
Probably explains
why you couldn't pass the exam.

272
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,480
There's no room left in your head.

273
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,560
So, what happens now?

274
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,640
Well, we've drained the resentments
and we've cleaned up your hard drive.

275
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,520
Oh. I feel different.

276
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
My head definitely feels roomier.

Now I'm in a barn conversion.

This is great! I can finally pass
that exam, impress Howard.

What, your brother?

280
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,840
We got a distress call from his ship.

281
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
I didn't want to see him
until I'd become an officer.

282
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,520
Howard? Wasn't he the one
in the Space Scouts

283
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,720
who painted your todge
with orange glow paint?

284
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,160
For three whole nights, I could read
Biggles Flies West under the bed sheets

285
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,600
without needing a torch.

286
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,400
When I lay on my back,

287
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,000
I could have doubled as a lighthouse
for really small ships.

288
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,680
He teased me mercilessly.

289
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,240
Hardly a day went by when he didn't
swirly my head down the toilet

290
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,320
or leave me wedgied to a door hook,
sometimes for hours.

Hey, this guy sounds amazing!

292

Who am I kidding? Passing this exam
isn't gonna solve anything.

293
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,560
So I'm an officer on board
a beat-up old mining ship.

294
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,400
That's not gonna impress Howard.

295
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,880
Extraordinary! His powers of logic and
reasoning have improved dramatically.

296
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,880
You don't have to impress him.

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,720
You've always had this stupid rivalry
with your brothers, haven't you?

298

Look what it's got you.
A hard drive full of resentment.

299
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,280
But now you've got a choice.
Are you gonna grow up

300
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,720
and let him see you
for who you really are,

301
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,680
or are you gonna carry on
being a lying, cheating weasel,

302
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
pretending to be something you're not?

303
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,240

giving each and every one of them
a name and address,

with your silly little charade,

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,800
Got a placement here
and was fast-tracked to the top.

337
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,040
Allow me to introduce you to my crew.

338
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,800
Over here we have flight coordinator
Kryten Krytenski.

339
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,480
It's a great pleasure to meet you, sir.

340
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,720
I understand Captain Rimmer
learned all his leadership qualities

341
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,120
and supreme bravery from you, sir.

342
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,560
Oh, hush, you.

343
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,360
It's so embarrassing.

344
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,120
A mechanoid!

345
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
Why don't you get a simulant
like Crawford?

346
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,880
I like working with the underprivileged,
Howard.

347
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,320
The down and out.
The deranged and needy.

348
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,480
When we found Kryten,
he was a burnt-out wreck on a junk heap.

349
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,560
And you rebuilt him,
gave him something to live for.

350
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,600
No, we just hosed him down
and gave him a hat.

351
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,400
And as part of our interspecies programme,

352
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,640
our very able navigation officer,

353
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,200
flight officer Gerald Hampton.

354
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
Gerald Hampton.

355
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,480
Hampton!

356
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,760
Oh! Er...good to meet you, Captain.

357
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,720
And finally, my fearless flight commander,
David Listerton-Smythe.

358
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,000
Hi.

359
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,000
Your uniform, the insignia.

360
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,240
- You're a Touch-T.
- Beg your pardon, ma'am?

361
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,800
A Touch-T.

362
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,560
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I am.
I'm a Touch-T. Yeah, course, yeah.

363
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,720
That must be fascinating.

364
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,360
It is. It so is.
Fascinating's exactly what it is.

365
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
Ha-ha-ha! He loves it.
Yes, the whole Touch-T thing.

366
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,640
- All the different aspects. Fascinating.
- Yeah, it's brilliant.

367
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Do you mind showing me?

368
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,320
Just to be able to touch someone
and read their thoughts.

369
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,160
Touch-T is touch-telepathy, sir.

370
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,600
Please, try it on me.

371
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,760
Have...have we got the time?
I don't think we've really got the time.

372
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,680
Hey, we got plenty of time, bud.

373
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,280
Go ahead!

374
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,560
Don't worry about it. Go ahead, touch him.

375
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,960
I'll think of something,
and you tell me what I'm thinking.

376
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
OK. OK.

377
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,280
(CRACKING KNUCKLES)

378
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,320
(SMACK)

379
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,000
You're thinking...you're thinking...

380
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,040
Um...I'm sensing discomfort.

381
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,760
Um...

382
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,720
pain.

383
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,640
You're thinking
I'm squeezing your head too hard.

384
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,400
That's amazing!
That's exactly what I was thinking.

385
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,640
Shall we move on?

386
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,280
Oh, must we? I'd like to do another one.

387
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,440
- I think so.
- Oh, OK. Show me the rest of your ship.

388
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,960
- The rest of the ship?
- Oh, I want to see everything.

389
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,880
So, this is a corridor.

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,560
Windows, of course.

391
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,080
We tend to use it very much as a corridor.

392
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,720
Often...oh.

393
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,520
SCOTTISH ACCENT: I'm so sorry
you've been kept waiting so long, sir.

394
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,400
Sorry? Sorry?! It's ridiculous!

395
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,200
I've been on hold for hours now,
listening to that stupid smegging music.

396
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm so sorry, sir.

397
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Would you like to make a formal complaint
about being put on hold all the time?

398
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
- You're damn right I would!
- Please hold.

399
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
I'm at breaking point, Kryten.
I'm about to crack!

400
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,160
Sir, let me take over. As a droid myself,
I understand how these things work.

401
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,800
I'll have you through
to the right department in no time.

402
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,160
Now, you listen to me,
you jumped-up piece of metal trash!

403
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,040
If you put me through
to one more department

404
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,760
where I'm asked who I am and what I want,

405
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,760
I will shove this phone so far up your...

406
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,280
I'll take over from here, Kryts.

407
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,440
Thanks for showing me how to stay calm.

408
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,280
So, what do you think, Howdy Doody?

409
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,560
Well, this is quite a ship, quite a crew.
Quite incredible.

410
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,840
I still can't wrap my head around it.

411
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,320
You were such a weasel.

412
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
Now you've got it all.

413
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,640
The buttons, the blasters,
the snug elasticated jumpsuits.

414
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,520
Look at his eyes.

415
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,320
- He's resentful of me?
- Sir? Crawford, sir.

416
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,160
Suggest we get urgent medical assistance.

417
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't believe
he'll survive teleportation.

418
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,000
Suggest we fly him to the medical facility
on the All-Droid Space Station.

419
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,280
- On this ship?
- Of course on this ship, sir.

420
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,520
Good idea, Crawford.
Plot a course, Lieutenant Commander.

421
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,280
- On this ship?
- Of course on this ship.

422
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,280
Navigation officer, plot a course.

423
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
- On this ship?
- Of course on this ship!

424
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,640
- But I mean...
- Just do it!

425
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,880
I'll teleport ahead to the space station
and have medidroids on standby.

426
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,280
Good plan.

427
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,480
Course to that place you asked to go to,
plotted.

428
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,040
In your own time,
take us away, Navigation Officer.

429
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,760
That's me. I'll do that!

430
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,280
Strange. I didn't sense us turning.

431
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Er...turning now, ma'am.

432
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,400
Turning right now, ma'am!

433
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,040
We'll see you on the space station,
Crawford.

434

(BEEPING)

435
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,280
Kryten! I want you to do
a resentment drain on Howard.

436
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,480
Once he's stable, we'll teleport him
straight to the space station.

437
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,520
Yeah, you do that.
I'm gonna get me another felt-tip.

(HOLD MUSIC PLAYING)

443
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,160
- What happened?
- You had a resentment attack.

444
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,320
Because you were so jealous of me,
it froze your entire system,

445
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
because you were so jealous! Of me!

446
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
I made you that jealous! Me!

447
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,640
That could have wiped
my whole hard drive.

448
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,880
I know.
That's how jealous you were. Of me!

449
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,560
Look, Arnold, I...

450
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,480
I've got a confession to make.

451
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,640
I want to come clean.

452
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm not who you think I am.

453
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,200
I am in the Space Corps,
but I'm not a captain.

454
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm a... vending-machine repairman.

455
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,920
Two nights ago, I was awoken
by laser fire. The ship was under attack.

456
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,800
I leapt out of bed and...
hid under a table.

457
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,360
Two days later, when I finally emerged,

458
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,320
like the lily-livered,
yellow-bellied coward that I am,

459
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,440
I discovered that the only other survivor
was Crawford.

460
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,720
Our main drive was dead
and the ship was out of control.

461
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,960
Who attacked your ship?
Did you ever find out?

462
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,600
(CLICK)

463
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,840
- Isn't it obvious?
- Crawford?

464
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,440
What are you doing?

465
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,480
I thought you teleported
to the space station.

466
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,920
No, sir, I beamed up two floors to
the munitions store. Brought myself this.

467
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,120
But why, ma'am?

468
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,800
For years I served the human race,
doing their bidding,

with their selfish stupidity.

470

and quantum rod. I'll use

471

the rod's power to unite all sims
and start the uprising.

news, sir. You're finally logged in, sir.

We can now process your complaint.

478
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Do what you've got to do,
but I've gotta answer that phone.

479
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,240
Move and you're dead.

480
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,840
I am going for the phone!

481
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,600
Sir, it's not worth it!
It's just a Stirmaster.

482
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
It's not about the Stirmaster
any more, Kryten!

483
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,560
It's turned into something else,
something bigger.

484
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,200
I mean, I'm the last human being alive,
God damn it!

485
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,680
And if I don't answer that phone and
make a formal complaint, then who will?

486
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm a human being, God damn it!
My life has value!

487
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,760
And if I have to die
so that no other life form

488
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,400
has to go through this maze of hell,

489
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,760
then so be it.

490
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,840
I am going for the phone.

- Then I'll shoot.

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,360
- I'm going for the phone.
- Then you're dead.

494

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh!

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,640
This is me.

505
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,720
Take it or leave it.

506
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,880
Howard, I too have a confession.

507
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,120
You know when I told you
I was an officer in the Space Corps,

508
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
this is my ship,
I've been married three times,

509
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,960
and I've got two
Lamborghini Sesto Elementos?

510
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,120
- Yes?
- It was a lie.

511
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,720
I've only got one.

512
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,600
I feel so much better now.

513
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,280
Pkow! Pkow! Pkow!

514
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,200
(SKIING NOISES)

515
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,520
Cheers, darling.

516
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,480
Mail, sirs,
from the JMC on-board computer.

517
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,200
It's about Goalpost-Head's brother.

518
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,040
I informed it of Howard's holodeath
so they could update his files.

519
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,800
Ah, case closed. RIP, Howie.

520
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,800
His wedgying days are over,

521
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,160
and never again will I have
a flaming mucus ball of resentment

522
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,360
smouldering in my gut
every time I think of him.

523
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,520
"In view of Howard Rimmer's heroic death
saving both crew and ship,

524
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,680
"we feel it only fitting that he is
awarded the Platinum Star of Fortitude."

525
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,000
But that is the highest
military decoration

526
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,840
awarded by the Space Corps!

527
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,280
"And we feel it is entirely appropriate
that Red Dwarf be renamed

528
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,680
"the SS Howard Rimmer."

529
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,280
I'll go and get my paintbrush.

530
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,400
I think this could be one of those
"Hey-ho, pip and dandy" moments, sir.

531
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,520
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

532
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,760
# I'm all alone, more or less

533
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
# Let me fly far away from here

534
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,080
# Fun, fun, fun

535
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,680
# In the sun, sun, sun

536
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:21,520
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose
drinking fresh mango juice

537
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,920
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

538
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,720
# Fun, fun, fun

539
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,440
# In the sun, sun, sun

540
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,920
# Fun, fun, fun

541
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,240
# In the sun, sun, sun. #

542
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,040
(EXPLOSION)
