00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,800
MAN: Next up, an experiment
to measure peer pressure.

3
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
How much is the individual

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,800
influenced by the group?

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,320
Seeing as Arnold Rimmer's late,
the subject of this experiment can be him.

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
When he finally does us
the honour of turning up,

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,920
I shall ask you a set of questions
and want you to answer accordingly.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,480
First day of term and I'm late!

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
So embarrassing. He'll kill me.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,640
Ahh!

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,160
Mr Rimmer!

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,560
I hope we haven't inconvenienced you
too much by starting on time.

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,760
Sorry, Father.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm Father outside college.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Inside college, I'm "sir"
or "Lecturer Rimmer", understand?

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,240
Yes, Father.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,320
I mean, sir.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
So embarrassing.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,520
We're just about to run through
a few questions as part of psy profiling.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,360
OK,

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,280
take a look at this colour.

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,680
Is it purple, blue or green?

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,200
Hands up, purple.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,840
Hands up, blue.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,800
Green.

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
A Fallopian tube is a musical instrument.

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,080
True or false?

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
True?

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,440
What's the answer
to this piece of arithmetic?

You kills my brother.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Hm?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,760
Oh, you got the wrong quarters, bud.

36
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
You want Lister.

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,520
That's two floors down,
second on the right, fourth on the left.

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,800
Night!

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,560
You kills my brother.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,080
One floor down, sir.

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
Elevator at the end of the hallway.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,240
You kills my brother.

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,280
Oh, smeg off, Rimmer.
I'm tryin' to sleep, man.

(COUGHS)

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,280
- You kills my brother.
- No, I didn't.

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh, yes, you did.

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,320
No, I smeggin' didn't.

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,040
I are here to challenge
theys who kills my brother

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,040
to a duel to the ungonising death.

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,760
I will give you five of your Earth minutes
and then...

52
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,280
I will pursue you across space
unto the end of time itself.

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,560
I will not rest until you are chokin'
on your own warm blood.

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
Sounds fair to me.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
Butt out, Rimmer. Don't encourage him.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,800
Do you accept the challenge, humo,
a duel across time and space?

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,080
- No!
- Why?

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,960
Hogey, you are always doing this -
picking fights

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,240
and then challenging us
to duels across time and space.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
- No, I not.
- Yes, you are.

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,360
No, I not.

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,760
Yes, you smeggin' are!

63
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,000
You rogue droids are obsessed
with duels across time and space.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,880
You eesult my kind, saying we are
obsessed with duels across time and space.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,480
I therefore challenge you

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,760
to a duel across time and space.

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,200
I will give you five of your...

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,160
No duels across time and space.

69
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
Why?!

70
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,520
Look, at first, it was fun, it distracted
us from being stuck in deep space,

71
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,240
no...way of getting back home.

72
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,760
But we're all duelled out -
our duelling days are over.

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,160
Duellos annonos.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,880
- Oh, please!
- No!

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,240
I-I will give you a leetle start.

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,000
- No!
- But we are in deep space.

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
It's light years from anywhere.

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,240
There be nothing else to do.

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,800
You think I don't know that?

80
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,000
So, how we gonna keep from going crazy?

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,880
For you, my friend, it's way too late.

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,120
How about a Ping-Pong marathon?

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
Get a few buddies together.

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,000
Rogue nutters versus the Dwarfers.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,720
We already do that.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,200
You guys, you always win.

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,400
Crazy golf, then, the botanical gardens.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,080
We'll give you a shot a hole.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,720
Oh, yeah, like we stand a chance.

90
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
What's wrong with that?!

91
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,080
You be knowing all the burrows,

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
how to get in and out
the little windmills.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,600
What else?

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,360
All right, tell you what.

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,280
A cooking contest.

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,320
Who can bake the most delicious cake -
we'll thrash you.

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,960
Not if it a choux pastry, you won't.

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Ooh, choux pastry.
Big words, my demented friend.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,040
What are we playing for?

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,920
- If I win...
- LISTER: Oh.

101
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,720
- BOTH: ...a duel across time and space.
- But if you win,

102
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,800
a great treasure,
the likes of which you have never seen.

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,520
A piece of old cloth?!

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,880
No, thanks, we've already got one.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
Hey, it's a map.

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,720
A map the likes of which
you have never seen.

107
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,400
Everything's the likes of which
you've never seen with him.

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,880
- Do you doubt me?
- I'm just sayin',

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,520
you'd be surprised
the likes of which we have seen.

110
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,080
Don't be so quick to say everything's
the likes of which we haven't seen.

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,880
We've seen things the likes of which
you probably haven't seen yourself.

112
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,680
Is that a challenge?

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,360
BOTH: No duels!

114
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,560
The map, it show
everything in this galaxy -

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,520
every wormhole,
every derelict, every planet.

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,920
Where d'you get this?

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,720
I steal from a Simulant Death Ship.

118
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Hm, you don't wanna mess
with those guys. They're deranged.

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,320
Once you cross them,

120
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,720
they hunt you down.

121
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Not me. I steal while they slumber.

122
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,160
I clever as a hedgehog.

123
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,920
Look out!

126
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,120
Sorry to intrude, sir.

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
Is now a good time to clean your quarters?

128
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,880
Certainly looks like
it could do with a good tidy.

129
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,360
Oh! Sorry, sir,
I didn't realise you had company.

130
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
I'll rework my schedule.

131
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,200
Sorry to intrude again, sir.

132
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,280
When is a good time for my lesson
on human modes of speech?

133
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,760
Oh, now's an excellent time, Kryten.

134
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,040
Come in, take a seat.

135
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
Oh, what fun, sir! That's sarcasm, right?

136
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,440
You see? I am getting the hang of it.

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,680
There's a ship outside.
They're attacking us.

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
He's sealed the crack.

139
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
- We've gotta get out of here.
- We can't just leave him.

140
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,480
RIMMER: Watch me.

141
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,240
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing.

142
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,160
Look, I'll be back.
I don't know how, I don't know when.

143
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,600
You abandon me?

144
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,080
Then I have no choice.

145
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
I challenge you to a duel...

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,160
Oh, what's the point?

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
(ALARM BLARES)

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,200
What the hell's going on?
Who's doing this?

149
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,720
Kryten, scan the local vicinity
for any anomalous energy patterns.

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,480
Everything's down, sir. We're on EPS.
Trying to reboot.

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,920
So, let me get this right.

152
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,920
We're being attacked by somethin'
but we don't know what,

153
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
and there's no way
of finding out what's out there?

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,440
- I have a suggestion, sirs.
- What?

155
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,000
How about we look out of the window?

156
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,680
Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.

157
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
Do it.

158
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
What, me, sir? On my own?

159
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,560
Of course on your own.

160
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
I love solo missions! I'm on my way, sir.

161
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,840
(RUMBLING)

162
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,440
Would you like a written report, sir,
or under these special circumstances,

163
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
would a verbal account suffice?

164
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,280
Get on with it, man! What's out there?

165
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,640
A rogue Simulant Death Ship, sir.

166
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,920
A Death Ship?

167
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
- Yes, sir.
- Should we be concerned?

168
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,600
Concern would be an entirely appropriate
response under these circumstances, sir.

169
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,600
What d'you think they want?

170
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,520
Although the Death Ship didn't indicate
the exact nature of their business, sir,

171
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm guessing
it's something a bit...deathy.

172
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
They must have been tracking Hogey.

173
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,400
- Finding us is just a bonus.
- CAT: Simulants!

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,960
These are the guys
who despise humans, right?

175
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,840
The ones who won't rest until
they've annihilated every single one.

176
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Correct, sir.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Not me, then. Excellent!

178
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,360
I'll be in the rec room, reading
this month's copy of I'm OK! Magazine.

179
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,880
Make no mistake, sir - they will see us
all as Mr Lister's lieutenants.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
They will show us no mercy.

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,840
Death Ships are captained
by special berserker generals

182
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,640
who've been crossbred

183
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,480
to create an insane
biomechanical entity...

184
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
of pure evil.

185
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,400
My Dominator, forgive me, I implore you.

186
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,320
The Earth one remains alive.

187
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,360
Forgiveness is a human quality,
Chancellor.

188
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,720
It has no meaning to a Simulant general.

189
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,320
You know what you must do.

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
(GULPS)

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,400
(GROANS)

192
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
Ooh.

193
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,920
Nuhh.

194
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,080
(GROANS)

195
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
Uhh!

196
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
Ohh! Uh.

197
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Firstly...

198
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,760
polish my Sword of Spite...

199
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
...as a punishment for your idiocy...

200
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Polish?

201
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,800
Yes. Polish.

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
As a punishment for your idiocy.
Secondly...

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,240
- Just polish?
- Yes, just polish!

204
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,640
Secondly...

205
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,400
write me a formal letter of apology.

206
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,680
So, you just want me to polish your sword
and write a letter?

207
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,560
Yes.

208
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,040
- Nothing else?
- Nothing else.

209
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
So, you don't want me to, er...
ooh, I don't know, er,

210
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,000
commit hari-kari or anything?

211
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,480
Of course not!

212
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,600
(SQUELCHING)

213
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,960
(DRIPPING)

214
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,320
Well, sir, that wasn't made very clear.

215
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,280
Er, when you slid the sword
across the table,

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,440
I naturally assumed
you wanted me to commit hari-kari.

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
- No, I do not!
- Oh, I know that now, sir.

218
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,560
Before, though, it was just...
you know, it was a bit ambiguous.

219
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
Er...

220
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
Er...

221
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,960
I think a new system is in order.

222
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm gonna go now, sir.

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,160
Er... My Dominator,

224
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,800
thank you.

225
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,280
Ooh.

226
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,600
Uhh.

227
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,920
Oh, Chancellor.

228
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,000
You do have a tendency
to jump to conclusions.

229
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Let this be a little lesson to you.

230
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
Oh.

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,160
Oh...

232
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,560
That bit looks important.

233
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,200
(CHUCKLES DARKLY)

234
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,080
Hang on, hang on.

235
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,000
Do you know how to work that?

236
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,280
It's got lots of different settings,
but yeah.

237
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,760
- Thought not.
- What the hell just happened?

238
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
What the hell is this thing?

239
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,760
CAT: It's a wibbly gun.

240
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
It makes things go all... (ROLLS TONGUE)

241
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
...wibblified.

242
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,240
It appears to destabilise the
molecular structure of solid objects, sir.

243
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
- His version was clearer.
- Come on. Cargo bay.

244
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Let's get to Blue Midget and CB3.

245
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,680
- (BEEPING)
- LISTER: Rimmer, what is that?

246
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,600
It's a holo-lamp, isn't it, sir.
It plays holo-messages.

247
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,560
My father gave it to me when I was a boy.

248
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,080
He told me to play it the day I become
an officer and join the Space Corps,

249
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,760
the day I become a somebody.

250
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,160
So, never been played, right?

251
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,760
- And it shan't be until I'm an officer.
- Come on, let's go!

252
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Death Ship and three Annihilators
at 6 o'clock, sirs.

253
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,640
Question. Can we stay ahead of them?

254
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,880
Only if we have enough fuel, sir.
Two, maybe three hours.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,600
Asteroid field 80 clicks west.
Maybe offer some cover.

256
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm taking her in.

257
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,360
KRYTEN: According to the readouts,
quadrant two, vector four.

258
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,000
- We can hide in that asteroid.
- CAT: Take us in!

259
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,120
My Dominator, I am afraid
the human insurgents have escaped.

260
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Er, they've flown into an asteroid field.

261
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
That is totally unacceptable!

262
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,520
I agree, My Dominator.
The security forces have been shambolic.

263
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,760
- Those responsible should be agonised.
- I-I agree also.

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,920
- And I.
- And I.

265
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,440
- And I.
- And I also.

266
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,040
Oh, I refuse to be surrounded
by these toadying sycophants.

267
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,840
- I agree, My Dominator.
- I agree also.

268
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
- And I.
- And I.

269
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,560
- And I.
- And I also.

270
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,520
I want each member of my council
to think for themselves,

271
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,080
not just agree with my every word and whim

272
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,160
out of some pathetic boot-trembling terror
for self-preservation.

273
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
Question my judgements.

274
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Debate me, yeah?

275
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,760
Only then will we be truly strong.

276
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,680
But-but, Dominator,
that simply isn't true.

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
I mean, the last person
to contradict you was...

278
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,400
- Kill him.
- What?!

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,200
Do you see what I mean?

280
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,920
Now, find the ship!

281
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,120
Ow...

282
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,520
It appears
they've surrounded the asteroid belt

283
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,040
and are sending in probes
to locate our position.

284
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,480
It's only a matter of time
before they find us.

285
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,240
So, what's our next move?

286
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,520
Shall I go slip into something
more appropriate, like, say, a coffin?

287
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Is that it? We're all gonna die?

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Well, you're all going to die.

289
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm already dead.

290
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,800
I had the sense
to get dying out of the way early.

291
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,240
For years, you mocked me.
Not laughing now, are you?

292
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,160
Oh, yeah, cos being dead
is such an advantage here(!)

293
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,760
- It is an advantage.
- How's it an advantage?

294
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,960
I was killed instantly, Lister -
painless, quick and stylish.

295
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,720
What's that coming down the corridor?

296
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,400
Ooh, it looks like a radiation leak.
Wham, dead.

297
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,360
Not perfect, I'll grant you,
but at least it wasn't embarrassing.

298
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
Embarrassing?

299
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,600
No weeping, getting hysterical.

300
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,920
Not one of those deaths where
you lose control of your bodily functions,

301
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
your bowels clearing all over the place.

302
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,160
At least my death was dignified.

303
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,160
I'd hardly call yelling,
"Mummy, Mummy," dignified.

304
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,080
Lister, I didn't yell, "Mummy, Mummy."

305
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,680
No, you didn't have the time.
You just yelled, "Mu..."

306
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,960
Please, sirs, this is very bad for morale.

307
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,560
I can't believe you're arguing
about who's going to have the best death!

308
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm only trying to help,
give you some advice on how to die nicely.

309
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,040
- You wanna die twice, keep talking.
- KRYTEN: Please, sir!

310
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,080
He's right. We're all getting crazy.

311
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
We need to chill.

312
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
You're right.

313
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,600
We've been in these situations before,
we always find a way out.

314
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,200
Like the time that highly corrosive
micro-organism almost destroyed Red Dwarf.

315
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,520
The highly corrosive
micro-organism, exactly!

316
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
We got out of that one.

317
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
Yeah, thanks to me.

318
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,880
Oh, sir!
You cannot claim the credit for that.

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,040
- It was a total fluke.
- Fluke?

320
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
You think that was an accident,
the way I...?

321
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,720
Ssh!

322
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
What's that?

323
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,720
Something's coming into the asteroid.

324
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,040
It's a probe.
It's approaching half a click east.

325
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,600
Switch out all the lights.

326
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,560
Good thinking!
They'll think we're all out.

327
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,440
If things get really tricky,
we'll get Kryten to open the airlock

328
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,160
and tell 'em we've moved.

329
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,080
It seems to be backing off, sir.

330
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,920
They're coming back.

331
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,720
Look, we've gotta get a battle plan -
astro-nav space-school stuff.

332
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,120
Rimmer, is that something
you could handle?

333
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,320
Pardon?

334
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,680
Is that something you can handle?!

335
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,240
The responsibility
of coming up with a battle plan?

336
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,680
All that strategy stuff.

337
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,960
Why me?

338
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Cos you're into military strategy.

339
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,360
If it was a curry-eating competition
to the death, it'd be me.

340
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,000
If it was a towel-folding competition
to the death...

341
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
That would be me!

342
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Phuw, phuw, phuw-phuw-phuw-phuw.

343
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,880
Phuw-phuw-phuw.

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,160
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

345
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,040
I'd win that one, sir.

346
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,480
And what kind of competition to the death
would it have to be before you chose me?

347
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,960
So, moving on... Er... Can you do it?

348
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,920
Yes, of course I can do it.

349
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,520
Obviously.

350
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,360
You don't sound very confident.

351
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm very confident.

352
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,920
I've waited my whole life for this moment.

353
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,400
Command of my own ship
in a battle against overwhelming odds?

354
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,880
It's your moment of destiny.

355
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
Right. I'll just...

356
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,560
make my way into the... supply room
and think of a plan, then.

357
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,360
It'll be just like taking an exam.

358
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,680
I can do this.

359
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,960
Sir, surely
there must be an alternative.

360
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,640
If there was, Kryten, we'd be doing it.

361
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
ALL: We're smegged.

362
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,120
Any joy, sir?

363
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,640
Not yet, no.

364
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm still at
the "can't think of a plan" stage.

365
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,120
Well, I don't know if this will help, sir,
but I've done a ship-wide search

366
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,960
and collated all the weapons
we have on board ship, sir.

367
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,680
Good, Kryten.
I was just about to suggest that myself.

368
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,160
Two forks and a pencil sharpener?!

369
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,640
Now, there is a rumour that
there's a stick and some string, sir.

370
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,080
But I don't want to raise false hopes.

371
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,800
There is, of course, Hogey's Molly-D.

372
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,960
- The molecular destabiliser.
- Mm.

373
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I'll leave it with you, sir.

374
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,920
Ehh!

375
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,240
They're driving me crazy
cooped up in there.

376
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
Thought I'd take a break and come in here!

377
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,240
Oww!

378
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,680
I love the string game!

379
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,480
Have you thought of your plan yet?

380
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
You can't think of anything, can you?

381
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,960
I just love the string game!
You know why?

382
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
Because you're an idiotic cat?

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,680
No. Why you can't think of a plan, dummy?

384
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,480
Because you're driving me crazy,
that's why.

385
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,480
Uh-uh. There's a demon
messing up your head.

386
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,000
- Yes, you!

387
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,320
Nope. Your father.

388
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,960
My father's dead.

389
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
No way, non-bud.

390
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,400
His worthless, skinny ass
lives on inside you,

391
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,680
freezing your soul with fear.

392
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
How do you know all this?

393
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,280
Do you think awesome good looks
and rock-hard pecs are my only qualities?

394
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm a cat.

395
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,960
I sense things.

396
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,160
You gotta nail that demon
and kick his sorry ass outta town.

397
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,440
How?

398
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,760
The only thing keeping him alive is you.

399
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,440
You're never gonna win over
that dude's approval.

400
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,520
Give it up! Let it go.

401
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
Hey!

402
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,280
Look how it's moving!

403
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
I lo-ove the string game!

404
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
Stop moving!

405
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,680
Anythin'?

406
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,960
Nothing.

407
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,920
What you doing?

408
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,840
- I'm going to play this.
- Your father's message?

409
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,600
- But why, sir?
- If I play it

410
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,680
before I've become the person
he wanted me to become,

411
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,240
it means I don't care
what he thinks any more.

412
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,520
It means...

413
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm free of him.

414
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,920
Arnold, it's me.

415
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,240
If you're playing this message, it means
you're an officer in the Space Corps.

416
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,600
You've achieved your dreams, you're
a man of significance and substance,

417
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,480
so this won't matter to you now.

418
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Arnold,

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,360
I'm not your father.

420
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,400
But that's impossible. It's not true!

421
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,880
Look inside yourself
and you will know I speak the truth.

422
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,520
Your father wasn't me.

423
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,400
It was Dungo, our gardener.

424
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,760
But he was a babbling imbecile.

425
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,440
A billion-piece jigsaw
suddenly falls into beautiful place.

426
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,200
Know from now on

427
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,120
your family line isn't made up
of Austrian princes and French royalty,

428
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,080
but of lame-brained artisans
and pram-faced trollops.

429
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,160
Didn't tell you before because I didn't
want it to affect your self-esteem.

430
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,920
But now you've achieved all your dreams,

431
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
it doesn't matter a jot.

432
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,040
Goodbye, Arnold.

433
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,760
And good luck.

434
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,800
PS - naturally, I won't be sending you
any more birthday presents.

435
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,560
This is the worst thing that can happen.

436
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,600
Mr Rimmer's always had
a huge ego and no self-confidence.

437
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,360
Now his ego's smaller than
a pixie's right nut after an icy bath.

438
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
Well, you know, he thought he came from
a military family, high-flyers,

439
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,760
success ingrained
in the very core of their DNA.

440
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Now he discovers he's no better than me.

441
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,640
What a nightmare.

442
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,240
(RIMMER SIGHS)

443
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,840
I think I've got something.

444
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,080
What? How?

445
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
I've been thinking.

446
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,920
If Dungo...

447
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
I mean Dennis...

448
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I mean Dad...

449
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,000
were here now, he'd be so proud.

450
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,040
Second Technician in the JMC,
senior officer in a mining ship,

451
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,560
and I don't smell of manure.

452
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,920
Suddenly I don't have
that voice in my head

453
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,800
telling me I'm useless at everything.

454
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,680
I have a new voice
telling me how proud he is.

455
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,160
I can think

456
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
and I think I've got a plan.

457
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
It's crap!

458
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,040
I have to admit, sir,
I'm not entirely convinced myself.

459
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,280
I thought it was quite clever.

460
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,320
- Let's take a vote.
- Who's against?

461
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,080
Take a look at this colour.

462
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,080
Is it purple, blue or green?

463
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,560
...Fallopian tube is a musical instrument.
True or false?

464
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,160
True?

465
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,080
It'll work! Jujitsu-style!

466
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,960
Use the might of your opponent
against himself!

467
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,640
Are you quite sure, sir?

468
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,640
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.

469
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,960
Apart from pain.

470
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,480
And maybe humiliation.

471
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
And obviously death and failure.

472
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,080
But apart from fear, pain, humiliation,
failure, the unknown and death,

473
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,960
we have nothing to fear but fear itself.

474
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,320
Who's with me?

475
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,320
I know I need to work harder
on that fear speech,

476
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,480
it wasn't quite as rousing
as it should be, but...

477
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,000
we can do this.

478
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,240
He's right! Let's do it.

479
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,720
- Let's do it! Come on!
- Come on!

480
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,680
- Get your butts in the air and let's go!
- Yeah!

481
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,840
LISTER: Kryten, bring them forks -
we might need them.

482
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,560
There, My Dominator.

483
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
- They're emerging from the meteor.
- Mm.

484
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,720
How's it looking? Is it all going to plan?

485
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,040
KRYTEN: Nothing in sight, sir.

486
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
Oh.

487
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,520
- We're surrounded.
- 12 o'clock,

488
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,520
9 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 3 o'clock.

489
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,920
LISTER: The Death Ship
and three Annihilators.

490
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,200
Keep them in line -
it's absolutely crucial.

491
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,120
- Right, open comm channels. Here goes.
- Open, sir.

492
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,440
This is Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer
of the mining ship Red Dwarf.

493
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,120
Under Treaty 5 of the Geneva Convention,

494
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,640
we claim the freedoms
and privileges of prisoners of war.

495
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,720
Ha!

496
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,920
- Load the photon mutilators.
- Mm.

497
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,120
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

498
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,440
We're surrendering.

499
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,840
Mutilators loaded, Your Excellency.

500
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,680
You can't open fire
on a surrendering ship.

501
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,960
That's a scandalous breach
of the niceties of battle.

502
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,400
All ships, prepare to fire on my orders.

503
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,040
Right! You're on report, m'laddo.

504
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,200
Fire!

505
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,440
Blow us up all you like,

506
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,320
but don't think for one second
you're getting away with it.

507
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,240
A letter worded in the strongest
possible language is going off to Geneva.

508
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,880
Now, I'm not gonna ask you again.

509
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,520
Abort your attack.

510
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,360
Right, that's it.

511
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,320
"Dear sir...

512
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,760
"I was scandalised earlier today
by a Simulant Death Ship

513
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,080
"which contravened Treaty 5
of the Geneva Convention."

514
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,600
Impact - 16 seconds.

515
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,080
It's the way of all things.

516
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,880
You live, you die.

517
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,440
But sometimes you live, you die

518
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,000
and then you live again.

519
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,600
I know. I've done it myself.

520
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,800
Now!

521
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,160
They've destabilised their whole ship,
all four bulkheads.

522
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,600
LISTER: Look out!

523
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,960
Our own torpedoes
are on a collision course, Sire.

524
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,320
Under Treaty 5
of the Geneva Convention,

525
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,440
we claim the freedoms and privileges
of prisoners of war!

526
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,600
Sorry, I missed that. Pardon?

527
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,640
(ALL CHEER)

528
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,760
- Good job, sirs.
- Hell of a job.

529
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,280
You know what this makes me?

530
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,520
A working-class hero.

531
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,480
Working-class hero, you and me both.

532
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,880
Kryten...

533
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,720
set a course for Red Dwarf.

534
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
The slime's coming home.

535
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,000
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

536
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,200
# I'm all alone, more or less

537
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,560
# Let me fly far away from here

538
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,400
# Fun, fun, fun

539
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,120
# In the sun, sun, sun

540
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,800
# I want to lie
Shipwrecked and comatose

541
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,040
# Drinking fresh mango juice

542
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,520
# Goldfish shoals nibbling on my toes

543
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,280
# Fun, fun, fun

544
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,960
# In the sun, sun, sun

545
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,800
# Fun, fun, fun

546
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,760
# In the sun, sun, sun. #

547
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,600
What did I tell ya? We got out of that OK.

548
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,800
Just like we got out of that thing
with the highly corrosive micro-organism.

549
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,080
- Once again, Big Arn saves the day.
- Oh, please, sir!

550
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,840
Can we sort this out once and for all?
Just because you happened...

551
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,920
You kills my brother.

552
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,800
(ALL SIGH)
