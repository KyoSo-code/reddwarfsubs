1
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,280
Ah! Morning, sir. Ohh!

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,240
I just love the hum of the air con first
thing in the morning. Don't you, sir?

3
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,760
Makes you just wanna
leap out of bed and mop!

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,640
- (DEJECTEDLY) Morning, Krytes.
- Oh, something wrong, sir?

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,240
Something getting you down?

6
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,960
Is it that you're the last human being
alive with no life, no family,

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,320
no future, no prospects, no hope, is it...

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,640
Is it something to do with that, sir?

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,360
Somethin' to do with that, Kryten, yeah.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,400
You're missing the human race again,
aren't you, sir?

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,080
Really missing 'em today, Krytes.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I just can't believe it's all over.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,960
I've been lookin' at
some old pictures of them,

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,520
remind me of the old days.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,360
Look, there's a picture
of them going to work.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Oh.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,120
Commuters, mm.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,280
There's another one. Look.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,240
- They're all laughing.
- Oh!

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,760
New Years, Titan.

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,240
We were so happy back then, Kryt.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,360
I had a species, I thought
the two of us'd be together for ever.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,960
Well, it may sound ridiculous now, sir,

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,400
but one day, I'm sure you'll meet another
species that'll make you just as happy.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,560
No, I won't! No species'll make me happy
like the human race.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
I'll never find another species
like them. They were...

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,200
They were special.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
Sir, all I'm saying is
there are other species out there,

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
and given time, who knows?

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,640
You never liked the human race, did you?

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,120
Quite honestly, sir, I never thought
they were good enough for you.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,240
I never thought
they were very nice to you, sir.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,960
Quite frankly, sir,
I think you could do better.

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,400
- What, better than the human race?
- Mm.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,520
It may sound harsh, but you've just
got to get them out of your mind

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
and get on with your life.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Yeah, but everywhere I look
reminds me of 'em.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,920
A couple of beers later on today, sir -
that'll take your mind off it.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
The human race invented beer.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
They were brilliant at inventin'.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,880
They invented sofas and blankets
and mops and floors and buckets.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,680
I just miss them so much.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,680
A change of scenery, sir,
that's what you need.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,920
Why don't you get out
and stretch your legs?

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
The human race had legs.

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
I just can't get away from them.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
Everywhere I look, it reminds me of them.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Nothing compares to them.

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,960
# Nothing compares

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,440
# Nothing compares to them. #

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,200
I knew they'd break his heart.

52
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,560
Oh!

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,640
Human race -
here one minute, gone the next.

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
Fly-by-night flibbertigibbets!

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,080
Life.

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
What's it all about, then?

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Why are we all here? Why am I here?

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
What's the point of everything?

59
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,760
I don't know, Dave.

60
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,120
White coffee, six sugars
and a caramel crisp bar coming right up!

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,760
Haven't you ever thought about it?

62
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,120
Not really, no. I'm a vending machine.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
Are you OK?

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,040
You don't seem your usual self today,

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,640
asking intelligent questions,
being philosophical.

66
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,440
How d'you know
what my usual self is like?

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,760
I watch you.

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,240
Through the crack in your door.

69
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,040
The things you do when you're alone
are so funny!

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
(LAUGHS)

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
I've gotta get going.

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,240
See you next time!

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,000
And if you want to talk things through
about life and stuff. drop by any time.

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, except Thursday morning.
I might be out.

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Just kidding!

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,240
I'll be here! (GIGGLES)

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,880
For ever!

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,960
Subbuteo tournament this weekend, Kryten.

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,840
Not going out in the quarterfinals
three years in a row.

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,280
Just putting the boys through their paces.

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
The flabsters don't know what's hit them.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,560
Er, an e-post from the JMC
on-board computer, sir.

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,920
Oh, yes? What do they want?

84
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
They've had a significant amount
of letters over the years

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,240
from high-ranking members
of the JMC, sir,

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,640
proposing you to be awarded

87
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,640
the Golden Stripe Of Honour
for your years of distinguished service.

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,800
Gosh. Really?

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,200
They say they've been told you're a modest
man who doesn't seek the limelight,

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,720
for your only concern
is performing your duties.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,160
I'm lost for words.

92
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
Such kindness.

93
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,880
They say, due to the number
of these letters of recommendation,

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,560
they have absolutely no option
but to request

95
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,440
you stop writing them.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,920
Oh, bollocking damn and jumbo buggers!

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,000
They go on to say,
in dealing with this matter,

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,000
they've looked into your actual
service record and have realised

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,760
that you haven't reported for duty
in over three million years.

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,600
But I've been dead for most of that!

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,880
You are therefore being charged
with gross dereliction of duty

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,840
and you have 24 hours
to present your rebuttal.

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
What?!

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320
If they find you guilty, sir,
you'll be demoted...

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,000
to third technician.

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
The same as Lister?

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,000
There'll be no-one but you to obey
my orders. What am I gonna do?

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,440
Help me. That's an order.

109
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, please, sir!
Don't order me to help you.

110
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,280
You know how much I hate helping you!

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
Kryten!

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Very well, sir.

113
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,280
Perhaps you could get a note
from the medicomputer

114
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,040
explaining you're unfit for duty.

115
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,120
Post-traumatic stress or something.

116
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,280
I haven't been the same since the crew
got wiped out - need a note, post-dated.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,880
Too unwell to attend myself.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,160
Off you go.

119
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,560
On my way, sir.

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,480
Ahh, you!

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,280
Still moping around in your mopey clothes,

122
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,160
listening to your mopey music,
being all mopey?

123
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,600
- If you want my opinion...
- Which I don't.

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
...it's time you manned up.

125
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,920
Listened to some brass band music.

126
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,160
Went for a bracing hike
in the diesel decks.

127
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,080
Given the options, I'll continue being
suicidal, if it's all the same to you.

128
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,680
And don't think this pity party's
going unnoticed.

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,240
I've noticed it.

130
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,680
And I've written it down
in a special report.

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
And let me tell you, m'laddo,
I pull no punches.

132
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Who's gonna read this special report?

133
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, me.

134
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
And maybe others... one day.

135
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
And they'll read,

136
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,840
"You are the star of your own mopeathon.

137
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,360
"You can't even be bothered
to get yourself a cup of tea any more.

138
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
"You dunk your biscuits in the fish tank."

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,160
I've seen you.

140
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,000
I was watching TV!

141
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,640
As long as it's wet and melty,
you don't care where you stick it.

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,640
Look, Rimmer, I'm depressed, man.
Give me a break.

143
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,120
And besides, I'm a careful dunker now.

144
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,720
Look left, look right,

145
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,800
mirror, signal, dunk.

146
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,800
It's time you stopped feeling sorry
for yourself, Lister.

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Every problem has an answer.

148
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Problem - your species is dead.

149
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,040
Answer - make some more.

150
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,600
And how am I gonna do that?

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Well, you've gotta prepare yourself,
haven't you?

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,280
Like a fighter pilot waiting to scramble.

153
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,840
If the perfect woman
walked through that door right now -

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,360
and by perfect, I mean
any female with working ovaries -

155
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,280
you wouldn't have a clue.

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,440
Perfect woman walked through that door,
I would be ready to scramble.

157
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,240
What, you think your old moves
would still work today?

158
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,520
You think that snaky, sneaky,
arm-round-the-shoulder trick

159
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,760
in a dark cinema is still cool?

160
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,240
Women today
would die laughing at that move.

161
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,680
That was my best move.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
I had a lot of success with that move.

163
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Women have moved on from that move.

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,760
Moves don't move on.

165
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,960
Moves move on.

166
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
What, moves move?!

167
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,920
Right, here's a Jacobean move.

168
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,120
A Jaca-what?

169
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,880
Oh, my lady!

170
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
Thy beauty doth radiate across the Earth,

171
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,360
like a raging forest fire
consuming everything in its path,

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,120
and reduces grown men to babbling fools.

173
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,640
Do you think that move would work today?

174
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,800
Not a chance - dead move.

175
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,560
The cloak across the puddle - dead move.

176
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,240
Strumming a mandolin
under the balcony - dead move.

177
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,560
How d'you know all this, Rimmer?
You know nothin' about women.

178
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,200
You know nothin' about nothin'.

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
Remember that documentary
we watched about breasts?

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,040
You thought "areolas"
was a Spanish goalkeeper?

181
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,520
Well, what was he, Italian?

182
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
It's not important.

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Look, you've either got it
or you ain't, and I've got it.

184
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm gonna make meself a cup of coffee.

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
(THUD)

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,120
Right, abusing the furniture.

187
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,840
It's all going down.

188
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,120
Oh, thanks, 23.

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
I really needed a lift.

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,280
(FRENCH ACCENT) No problem, David.

191
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,120
How was zat soup I made you yesterday?

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,880
- It was, er... pretty delicious, actually.
- Ah, bon!

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
- I'm glad you enjoyed eet'.
- Yeah, it was really nice.

194
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
Magnifique!

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,280
So, um... you look different.

196
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Have you changed something? New facade?

197
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
Really suits you. You look, er... shinier.

198
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,600
No, same facade as always.

199
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,000
Could've sworn it's different.

200
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
- Maybe it's the light.
- Oui, maybe.

201
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Oh, it's good coffee, this. Great coffee.

202
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Some amazing coffee.

203
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,400
I've always said to the others, you know,
if you want a good cup of coffee,

204
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,360
go to Dispenser 23 -
she makes the best coffee.

205
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,520
- Are you 'itting on me?
- What? No!

206
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm a vending machine -
why are you trying to 'it on me?

207
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,640
- I'm not trying to hit on you.
- You so are.

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,560
No, I'm not! I'm really not.
You just make good coffee, that's all.

209
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,840
"New facade, you look shinier" -
zat was a move.

210
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
- It was not a move!
- It so was a move.

211
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,200
You were putting a move on me.

212
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,080
You're getting the wrong end of the stick.
It was not a move, now please!

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,240
Why are you 'itting on
a dispensing machine? Who does zat?

214
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
- I'm not! I mean...
- Is everything OK, sir?

215
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,360
You know what he just tried to do?
He was 'itting on me.

216
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
Hit... hitting on her! I mean...

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
of course I wasn't hitting on her -
she's a vending machine!

218
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,680
Why would I hit on a vending machine?

219
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,840
I- I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding here.

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
He put his hand on my logo.

221
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,520
- (GASPS)
- What? When?

222
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
Look, I was leaning,
it was a total accident!

223
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Oh, leaning and you just happened
to place your hand exactly on my logo.

224
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,000
"Oops, sorry, didn't notice it "
he said, as he gently grazed my logo.

225
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,920
Unbelievable!

226
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,480
- This is gonna go in the report.
- (LISTER SIGHS)

227
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,880
RIMMER: What news of my sabbatical?

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,440
KRYTEN: I'm afraid it's not good, sir.

229
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,520
The medicomp said no? It's never liked me.

230
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,400
It's happy to give you a note
if you have a genuine reason for time off,

231
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,880
otherwise there's nothing doing.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,520
Although I got the impression
a charitable donation to the medical fund

233
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,200
might not go unnoticed.

234
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,640
Hmm. A little bribe.

235
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
Not a bribe, sir - a donation.

236
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,840
A big donation.

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,040
Mm! Where you gonna get
major moolah like that?

238
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,400
Expenditure cuts, sir,
from the supplies budget.

239
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,880
I've been looking at the ship's inventory
for potential savings,

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,280
and it seems to me, for a ship this size,

241
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,160
with this many
toilet-active crew members...

242
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,800
Toilet-active crew members?

243
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,800
...there's an astonishing amount
of toilet paper in the 2,143 restrooms

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
going to waste.

245
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,280
You what?!

246
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Toilet paper that never goes into action,
never sees the field of battle.

247
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
- Return the toilet paper!
- Hang on.

248
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Make the majority
of the restrooms paper-free.

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,520
I-I need that toilet paper!

250
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,280
Every sheet!

251
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,080
I've got a diet
that's rich in fibre, curry and beer.

252
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,240
The savings would be insane.

253
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,360
We can get a reimbursement from Supplies
and transfer that to the medical fund.

254
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,080
As far as the supply budget is concerned,
we're just moving money around.

255
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,480
It's totally above board.

256
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
I'll get on it right away.

257
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,320
- Great plan.
- Lousy plan!

258
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,920
Buds, I've got a question for you.
What's the best way to break bad news?

259
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,480
Well, generally speaking, sir,
you tell the people to sit down

260
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,760
and warn them that you've got bad news.

261
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,640
And what kind of face you got on?

262
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,080
A serious face, sir.

263
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,560
Kindly but serious.

264
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,240
Huh! Kindly but serious.

265
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,760
That's what I thought!

266
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
I knew that!

267
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,480
Thanks, bud!

268
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,680
Buds, best you sit down.
I've got some bad news.

269
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,520
Whoa, what is it? What's happened?

270
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,400
Is this about me? It's about me, isn't it?

271
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm being replaced again, aren't I, sir?

272
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,400
You know everyone's sitting down,
then you say something like,

273
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,840
- "Listen, I've got bad news," right?
- That's correct, sir.

274
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,440
OK, here comes the bad news.

275
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,840
But I'm gonna do it as char-aydes!

276
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,320
ALL: Char-aydes?

277
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,520
He means "char-ahdes", sir.

278
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,680
You know how much fun
there is round here? None!

279
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
It's too good an opportunity to miss.

280
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,560
OK, here we go.

281
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
Remember, really bad news.

282
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,760
Two words.

283
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
KRYTEN: Whole thing.

284
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,600
Ho-hole. Er, black hole,
we're being sucked into a black hole.

285
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Er chameleonic mutants. Er, er, er,
brain-eating chameleonic mutants on board.

286
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,920
- A giant death worm!
- Something's happened to Kochanski.

287
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
She's got a rogue virus.

288
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,880
- Rimmer's got a rogue virus.
- No, no, no.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I've got a rogue virus?

290
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
- RIMMER: Er, explosion?
- Zombies, zombies!

291
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm being replaced, aren't I, sir?
No-one likes me. People have complained

292
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
- about the shape of my head.
- Strangling...

293
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,760
RIMMER: A giant death worm. Giant
death worm heading straight for us...

294
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,960
- Crash, something's crashed.
- (ALL TALK AT ONCE)

295
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,160
RIMMER: Heading straight for us.
I'm being demoted.

296
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,440
A woman! A woman's coming.

297
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,480
- A woman. Shorter.
- Small woman. Small. Male, man.

298
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,920
- Male.
- Post! Mail pod!

299
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,960
Mail pod!

300
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,240
- LISTER: Mail pod!
- KRYTEN: Mail pod!

301
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
- The mail pod's arrived!
- Mail pod's arrived!

302
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,160
LISTER: Brilliant, the mail pod's arrived!

303
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,680
- And something's happened to it.
- Something bad.

304
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,920
LISTER: It's crashed.
The mail pod's crashed.

305
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
- It exploded.
- It turned into a giant death worm.

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,480
- LISTER: It's turned into a jacket.
- A giant death worm's come out of it.

307
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,080
This is nothing to do
with a giant death worm!

308
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,560
Where were you getting
the giant death worm from?!

309
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Oh! Your clothes... your clothes
were on a... on a washing line...

310
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
- LISTER: Jacket.
- ...and mail pod came in

311
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,520
and crashed into your clothes!

312
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,240
Got it in one!

313
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,840
"Your clothes are hanging on the line,
and the mail pod crashed into them?"

314
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,120
How's that two words?

315
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,680
Cos when it happened, I said,

316
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,280
"Oh, man!"

317
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,440
You know,
if I had a giant death worm right now,

318
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
I'd stick it right down
your stupid throat!

319
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
Hey, the mail's arrived!

320
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,360
Lighten up - mail from Earth!

321
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,120
Death worm?!

322
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
Two words!

323
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
That's the last one, sirs.

324
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
We must have sifted through
about a thousand letters now.

325
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,040
One letter from home,
that's all I'm asking -

326
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,320
just one lousy, stinking letter.

327
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,160
Look, 50 big ones
says the first letter's mine.

328
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,600
Why is everything a competition with you?

329
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,680
Why can't we just sit here
and sort the mail like two mature adults

330
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
instead of behaving like two schoolboys
who have to bet on everything?

331
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
Oh, yes, I've got one!

332
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,800
Arnold Rimmer!

333
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,320
The man, the myth, the legend!
Rimmsy, Rimmsy!

334
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Mr Popular with a capital P,
there's no stopping him, here he goes!

335
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,040
Who's it from?

336
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,400
It's a parking fine.

337
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
Still good.

338
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,880
Still a letter -
something to read addressed to me.

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
One-nil, Rimmsy.

340
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,000
Is it? Can it be?

341
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,320
It can't be.

342
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh, but it is!

343
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
One-all! The comeback kid!

344
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,200
This boy does not know the meaning
of the word "defeat"!

345
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
One-all!

346
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
Go on, then, who's it from?

347
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,760
Hayley Summers?

348
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,640
My God, Hayley Summers!

349
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,400
Hayley Summers!

350
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm guessing it's from Hayley Summers?

351
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,360
I used to go out with Hayley Summers.

352
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,120
It's when I was trying to be a rock god.

353
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,640
What I lacked technically
I made up for in loudness.

354
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,280
I mean, when I played,
people had ringing in their ears.

355
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,920
How long for?

356
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,000
It didn't go away.
Once they had it, they had it for good.

357
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,320
That's how loud I was.

358
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,040
So where did you meet her, then?
At a gig?

359
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,560
She worked in the bank
where I had my overdraft.

360
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,200
We got talking, and badda-boom,
badda-bish, badda-baa.

361
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,400
And, um, she dumped you, right?

362
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,080
No, she didn't dump me, actually, Rimmer.

363
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,840
She got offered a dream job on Callisto,
couldn't turn it down.

364
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,560
The only girl I ever cared about
who didn't dump me, actually.

365
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,800
The time we had together
was brilliant, man.

366
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,440
We'd stay home all day Saturday,
watch zero-gee, eat curry in bed.

367
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,400
The first person I ever heard say,
"the real McCoy".

368
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
"That's the real McCoy," she'd say.

369
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,640
"This is the real McCoy.
That curry is the real McCoy."

370
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,400
And she squidged up her nose, like that,
when she was telling a story.

371
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,840
No, no, it was really cute.

372
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,920
And did you used to tell your friends

373
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,520
about the real McCoy
and the squidgy nose thing?

374
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,800
And did you find your friends
were suddenly emigrating

375
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
or pretending to be dead?

376
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
Still smells of her perfume.

377
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,360
Look, I... I don't wanna read this.

378
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
It'll make me miss home more than ever.

379
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,280
I'll read it.

380
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,360
"Dear Dave, I hope
you don't mind me writing to you,

381
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,040
- "but I've got a confession."
- Confession?

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,240
Bet she was a man.

383
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,720
Well, you said yourself she liked zero-gee
and curries. Bet you she was a man.

384
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,520
Did she have big feet?

385
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,320
When you did the foxtrot,
did you ever wonder why she was shaving?

386
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,840
Just- just tell me the confession.

387
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,440
- Oh, wow.
- What?

388
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,520
- No way!
- What?!

389
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,480
I don't know whether to laugh or laugh.

390
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,920
"Dave, I don't know how to tell you this,

391
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,280
"but I'm pregnant.

392
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,560
"Seven weeks, according to the doctor."

393
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,640
Pregnant? Hang on,
my head's on spin cycle here.

394
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,040
Are you saying that
I'm three million years into deep space

395
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
and she's pregnant with my baby?!

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,360
Well, put it this way -
you're in the finals.

397
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,840
Finals? What d'you mean?

398
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
I mean, who's the other finalist?
Who am I playing?

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah...

400
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,640
"I don't know whether it's yours or Roy's.

401
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,440
"Thought you should know."

402
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,600
Roy?

403
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,520
Ah, not Roy?!

404
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,240
Not Roy Roy!

405
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
D'you mean she was sleeping with Roy?

406
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,920
Who's the dad, me or him?

407
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,560
She doesn't know,
she's going for a DNA test.

408
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,040
She must've written another letter
to tell me the result.

409
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
You've gotta help me find it, we need
to find this letter. Yellow envelope.

410
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
Yellow envelope!

411
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,120
Hi, 34. Just having a break.
Coffee, please.

412
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,800
Oh, you want something
from me now, do you?

413
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah, coffee.

414
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,520
Don't play dumb, Dave.
I heard what happened.

415
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,320
- Happened?
- With dispensing machine 23.

416
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
You didn't think I'd find out, did you?

417
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,040
- What?!
- All those drinks

418
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
and chocolate bars you were getting
off me, and at the same time,

419
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,920
you were drinking her drinks and snaffling
up her choccy bars too, weren't you?

420
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,280
Weren't you?!

421
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,640
She was just nearer.

422
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,200
She's such a trashy-looking machine.

423
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,840
Is that what you like, Dave? Trashy?

424
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
You all look identical!

425
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
- Ohh!
- Look, can I please just get a coffee?

426
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,040
- I'm out of coffee.
- I'll have a tea, then.

427
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,120
No tea.

428
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
Milkshake?

429
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Let me just check.

430
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,400
Sorry, no milkshakes either.

431
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,400
Look, I'll go somewhere else, then.
You're not the only dispenser on board.

432
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,960
Why don't you do that?
I think it might be best all round.

433
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,240
Well, I will.

434
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
- Good.
- Fine.

435
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
- Suits me.
- Right, I'm off.

436
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,200
Not missing you already.

437
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,680
Coincidentally, no big deal,
but know your tea?

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,040
it's a bit watery.

439
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,960
And you know when I said that your Mexican
red-hot chilli crisps were really spicy?

440
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,320
Well, I was lying.

441
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,800
- I can't believe you said that!
- Well, I did.

442
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,400
Ohh!

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,880
How did it go with the medicomputer?

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,280
Well, it took the donation, sir.

445
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,520
And what did we get?

446
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,800
A thank you.

447
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,280
Is that it?

448
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,880
I think it does this all the time, sir -

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
misleads unsuspecting bribers to get them
to give money to the medical fund.

450
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,960
That's outrageous!

451
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,680
Has it got no morals at all?

452
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,240
It repeated that the only way it could
give you an 'absence from duty' note

453
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,840
was if you are unwell

454
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,200
or you'd taken a sabbatical
to care for an unwell member of the crew.

455
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,880
Lister!

456
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,120
Post-traumatic stress.
Missing the human race,

457
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,560
dunking biscuits in the fish tank,
totally off the rails.

458
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,760
Well, most of that could be dismissed
as eccentricity rather than illness, sir.

459
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
If you're going to use Mr Lister in your
defence, I fear you need something more.

460
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
Hmm.

461
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,520
One act of saliva-dripping, mouth-foaming
insanity by midnight tonight.

462
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
Shouldn't be too hard.

463
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
Hey, bud.

464
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,760
Alphabet Head told me what happened.

465
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Come to check you out.

466
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
So, who is this Roy dude?

467
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Used to work with her in the bank.

468
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,320
He was always using the finger-wetting
machine to count the money.

469
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,000
Real creep.

470
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,760
Could I give you a bit of advice?

471
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't think about them together.

472
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,680
- Just move on.
- Right.

473
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,720
Keep all those "them together" thoughts
right out of your head.

474
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah, right.

475
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,440
All the walking in the park,
kissing raindrops off her nose stuff -

476
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
don't think about any of that.

477
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,440
I used to love her nose.

478
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,960
She used to squidge it up
when she told stories.

479
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,840
And don't be tempted to wonder
if she squidged up her nose for him

480
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,480
in that really cute way
she used to squidge up her nose for you,

481
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,720
cos the chances are, she did.

482
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,080
- You reckon?
- And another thing.

483
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Don't start thinking about all those
late-night shifts she was always doing,

484
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,160
because if it was me,
I'd be thinking, like, "Hey!

485
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,600
"Banks all close at five."

486
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,440
Yeah, she was always doing
late-night shifts.

487
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,080
You know, supervising the delivery
of the unstealable pens.

488
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,680
Or staying behind to help update
the bank queue waiting-pole rope.

489
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,520
Or accidentally locking herself
in the vault for the whole weekend.

490
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,080
She used to always do that.

491
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,360
Hey, you don't think
she was with this Roy guy?

492
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
The whole damn time.

493
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,520
- It never even occurred to me.
- But the key is,

494
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,440
don't think about it.

495
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm not thinking about it.

496
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,680
- Think of something else.
- I'm thinking of something else!

497
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,120
Good!

498
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,800
Cos if you start thinking about all those
hours you were sitting at home,

499
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,920
killing time, while she was probably
on all fours, covered in money...

500
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,960
...while his finger-wetting machine
was working overtime...

501
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
...it'll drive you crazy!

502
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,640
Now, you get a picture like that in
your head, it's real hard to get rid of.

503
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,920
What you doing?

504
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,240
What d'you think I'm doing?

505
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,640
I told you not to think about it!

506
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm thinking about it now!

507
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
That's unbelievable!

508
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,720
You've not listened to a word I've said.

509
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Still nothing, sir?

510
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,920
You know, I'm starting to think
she never even wrote a second letter.

511
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,120
Oh, sir, I know
this has stirred things up a bit,

512
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,320
but I really believe
you've got to live in the present.

513
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,600
You've got new friends now.

514
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,200
True, they may not be human, and some
of them are annoying and stupid and petty

515
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,800
and maybe even insane,

516
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,240
but that doesn't mean
they're any less precious.

517
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,800
You've got to forget about the past
and look after the present.

518
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
Hiya.

519
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,640
Oh, it's you.

520
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,960
This is awkward.

521
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,680
Look, I'm sorry about before.

522
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,360
I just wanna know if there's any way
I can make it up to you.

523
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,120
- Really?
- Yep.

524
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,040
Oh, Dave!

525
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I don't know why we fight like this.

526
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,040
We're so silly!

527
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,520
So what's it to be, then?

528
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,800
New paint job, new nozzle housings?

529
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,360
How about a restock?

530
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,400
- Anything?
- Anythin'. You name it.

531
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,280
Well, if I could have anything,
absolutely anything,

532
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,880
I've always wanted...

533
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,200
to see around the corner.

534
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,440
What, down there round the corner?

535
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,280
Oh, I know it's crazy,

536
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,920
but it's always been a wild dream of mine.

537
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,640
I've heard stories,
but to actually see it myself...

538
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
I can't believe I'm actually going!

539
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
- Isn't this romantic?
- Well...

540
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
don't build your hopes up too much.

541
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,760
It might not be as great as you think.

542
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,000
Da-daaaan!

543
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,400
- Well?
- Oh! Ohhh!

544
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,680
It's everything I thought it was and more.

545
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,200
Oh! Oh, Dave.

546
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
Maybe we could stay here.

547
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,480
You and me.

548
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,680
I know it's...crazy,

549
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,000
but we could settle down here.

550
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,440
Hm? Start a new life!

551
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, put me back there by the wall.

552
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh!

553
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,040
- Oh, Dave!
- Smeg, sorry!

554
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,800
I knew you'd come round, you naughty boy!

555
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,640
Rrrrar!

556
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,560
I'll get you up.

557
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,440
Oh! Dave!

558
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,240
Dave! Naughty boy!

559
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,640
Wow!

560
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,920
I have never seen a ceiling.

561
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
(GIGGLES)

562
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,960
(LISTER GRUNTS)

563
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,960
Rimmsy, Rimmsy, Rimmsy!

564
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,440
Oh, yes! CCTV!

565
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,880
Sabbatical note, here we come!

566
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,520
What would you have me do with these, sir?

567
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
Ohh.

568
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440
What did I tell you, sir?

569
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,440
I knew you'd find another species
to settle down with!

570
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm just tryin' to pick her up.

571
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,840
Looks like you're well past
that stage to me, sir.

572
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
(GROANS)

573
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,320
Damn paper!
There's gotta be some somewhere.

574
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,920
Ahh!

575
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,480
Ooh! Guhh!

576
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,040
Damn near walked three miles!

577
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,800
Hey...

578
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,080
Uhhh!

579
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

580
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,960
Oh!

581
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,880
That's every letter checked, sir.
It wasn't there.

582
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,160
Oh, well. Thanks, Krytes.

583
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,760
Never mind, third technician!

584
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,720
Three decks, not one single roll!

585
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,160
Hey, that's mine.

586
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,640
The hell it is. I found it.

587
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,480
I need it.

588
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,400
- Give it here!
- I need to wipe!

589
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,120
You see what you guys have done to us?

590
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,640
This is madness!

591
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,360
Madness!

592
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,160
That's my special report!

593
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,360
It won't be special in a minute.

594
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,800
I've realised now this might be it.

595
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,600
This might be the answer
as to why I feel so empty.

596
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,360
I mean, if she had my kids,
that means my kids might have had kids.

597
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,160
There might be hundreds
of generations spawned by me.

598
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,000
I might have had a daughter
who was a doctor

599
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,560
or a great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandson

600
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
who was a zero-gee football star.

601
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,320
No matter what happens to me now,

602
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,880
I feel like I've contributed.

603
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,960
I am someone.

604
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,000
Man, I hope it's mine, because I know,
with her as a mother, they would have been

605
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,280
the best kids they could possibly be,
cos I mean, she was a wonderful woman,

606
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,480
and I'm sure she'd have been
an even more wonderful mother.

607
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,920
Wish me luck.

608
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,400
What an absolute slag.

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,360
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

610
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,480
# I'm all alone, more or less

611
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,920
# Let me fly far away from here

612
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,840
# Fun, fun, fun

613
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,520
# In the sun, sun, sun

614
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,000
# I want to lie
