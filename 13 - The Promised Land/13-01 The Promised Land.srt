if I was a woman I wouldn't be hot?

you wouldn't be in no plane,

Big words, my mechanoid friend,

174
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
but for all your cleverness, and despite
being as well hung as Action Man,

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,680
it's not really getting us anywhere,
is it?

176
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,760
(BEEPING)

177
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,200
This is an SOS distress call.
Is anyone out there?

178
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,360
Our ship has run out of fuel
and we're presently

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,880
hiding from our feral overlords on
a transport vessel called the Iron Star.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,880
- (BEEPING)
- Please help us. We're in great danger.

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,560
An SOS distress call?

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,440
I'll try and re-establish a link, sir.

183
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,600
Sod them, Kryten.

184
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,000
We've reached an age now where
it's time to enjoy the home comforts

185
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,640
and curl up by a winter fire

186
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
and keep taking our various medications
to keep us sprightly.

187
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,800
Not board derelict ships

188
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,760
and have to flee from giant genetically
engineered man-eating cheese.

189
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,040
Well, I'm sure
Mr Lister won't agree with you, sir.

190
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,320
Don't tell him, then.

191
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,280
In fact, erase all memory
of the distress call from your memory.

192
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
That's an order.

193
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,200
- Yes, sir.
- (BEEPING)

194
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,560
Did you do it?

195
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,520
Did I do what, sir?

196
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,680
Did you erase the SOS distress call
from your memory?

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,960
We've received an SOS distress call?!

198
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,048
Damn, why did I say that?

199
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:07,720
Right,

200
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,040
erase all memory of
me asking you to erase

201
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,800
all memory of the SOS distress call
from your memory.

202
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,800
That's another order.

203
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,560
- Yes, sir.
- (BEEPING)

204
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
- Have you?
- Have I what, sir?

205
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,880
Have you just done
what I asked you to do?

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,560
You mean have I fixed the distortion?

207
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,000
Why would I be fixing the distortion?

208
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,160
(BEEP)

209
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,080
Sir! I think we've received
an SOS distress call!

210
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
Erase that from your memory too.
That's another order.

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,080
- Erasing distortion order, sir.
- (BEEPING)

212
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,080
What's the last thing you remember?

213
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,960
You want me to follow you, sir.

214
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,120
How did I get here?
We were in the corridor.

215
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,440
I knew I needed a service!

216
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
Excellent.

217
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,360
Guys, guys, you're never gonna guess
what we've found, me and Cat.

218
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,600
You see, I told you it wasn't all junk
in the sleeping quarters.

219
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,560
I refuse to even step into
that toxic cesspit of filth.

220
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
- What have you found, sir?
- Holly's spare disk.

221
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,320
The defence rests.

222
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,640
Holly had a spare disk? Oh, where is it?

223
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,480
Let's get it installed.

224
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,960
That's his disk?

225
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,040
Back in the day, this was the forefront
of advanced technology.

226
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,440
I bet people couldn't believe

227
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,680
how they'd managed to cram
his entire operating system

228
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,160
onto such a teeny-weeny disk.

229
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,600
Well, hold on, where's it gonna go?

230
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
We're looking for a slot bigger than
the Incredible Hulk's butt crack.

231
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,560
I always wondered what this was for.

232
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,600
What are we waiting for?
Let's get Holly booted up!

233
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,200
OK, come on, bring her round.

234
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,520
To me, to me.

235
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,600
Higher.

236
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,040
Higher, higher, higher, and push.

237
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,800
(WHIRRING AND BEEPING)

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,520
It still works.

239
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,720
(DIAL-UP BEEPS)

240
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,360
It's connecting to the ship.

241
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,240
(WHIRRING AND BEEPING)

242
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,360
My name is Holly.

243
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,200
Holly, it's us. You're back, dude.

244
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,040
I am Red Dwarf's computer.

245
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
I have an IQ of 6,000.

246
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
What's wrong with him?

247
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,960
He's been in the cargo bay
for three million years,

248
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,080
leaning up against a damp wall.

249
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,840
That should've made him better, not worse.

250
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,040
Who are you? Please explain.

251
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,640
Ha, of course.
He's returned to factory settings.

252
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,360
He doesn't know who we are.

253
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,560
Holly, allow me to introduce myself.

254
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,440
I am First Technician Arnold J Rimmer, BSc SSc.

255
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Acting Senior Officer of Red Dwarf.

256
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,640
This is Kryten,
an unimportant sanitation droid.

257
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,080
Cat - a Felis sapiens.

258
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,360
And Lister - a human. Or so he maintains.

259
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,080
I can't find any record of Kryten
or a Cat in the ship's manifest.

260
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,520
No record? I've won best ass on board
for 30 years straight!

261
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,880
That's cos they weren't
part of the original crew, Hol.

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
Cat descended
from domestic house cats.

263
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,720
And we found Kryten
on this crashed ship, the Nova 5.

264
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,680
He was looking after three skeletons.
Totally unhinged.

265
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,520
But now I'm on Red Dwarf.

266
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,000
Fitting right in!

267
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,800
Are you aware of the role I perform,
Hologram Rimmer?

268
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,920
You're the Red Dwarf computer, Holly.
You control the ship.

269
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm also tasked with appraising
Red Dwarf's worth

270
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,080
to the Jupiter Mining Corporation

271
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
and decommissioning it
If it serves no useful purpose.

272
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,840
Oh, God.

273
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,600
Obviously, this doesn't happen
while a ship

274
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,520
has a crew performing essential duties.

275
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,360
Oh, God.

276
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,000
Or even performing duties
to an adequate level.

277
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,400
ALL: Oh, God.

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
Ah, but Holly, if I may,

279
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,080
JMC protocol insists
no ship may be decommissioned

280
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,640
if it contains living crew members
who are listed on the manifest.

281
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,200
All righty, then, we're sorted.
I'm listed.

282
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,520
Looking through the records,
Crewman Lister,

283
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,520
I see you smuggled an unquarantined cat
on board.

284
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,880
As a result, you have forfeited
all your crew privileges,

285
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,840
including your rights of residency
on Red Dwarf.

286
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
I will therefore decommission the ship.

287
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,360
Meaning what?

288
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,560
Red Dwarf will be retired
from active service.

289
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,840
He's crazy.

290
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,120
As part of this process, the ship's
nuclear reactors will be dumped

291
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,120
in the nearest black hole,
along with the ship's hologram.

292
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,560
He's starting to win me around.

293
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,520
You can't dump me in a black hole.
I have my rights!

294
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
We want to appeal.

295
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,040
Maybe not all of us.

296
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
I will begin the deactivation process.

297
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,720
Due to the complexity of this operation,
it will take seven days.

298
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,240
Kryten said you wanted to see me.

299
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,160
Yeah, I need your advice.
This door keeps jamming.

300
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
And you wanna repair this now?

301
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,200
I've no record of
a malfunctioning door in Airlock 7.

302
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,720
Ah, well, maybe the feedback system's down
as well, Hol. We'll check it out, yeah?

303
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,920
Cover your mouth.

304
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
He can't hear us?

305
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,080
He may have an IQ of 6,000

306
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,520
but is he as smart as us
when we put our heads together?

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,880
Not even close.

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,120
Look at him, the gormless gimp.

309
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,400
Can't hear a word we say.

310
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,320
RIMMER: So what are we gonna do?

311
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,800
No choice. We're going
to have to shut him down.

312
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,320
But how?

313
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
EMP.

314
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,880
Electromagnetic pulse weapon?

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Everything shuts down, we uninstall Holly.

316
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,200
Then we toss the dozy wazzock
back on the garbage pile he came from.

317
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,240
Kryten's working on the EMP right now
in the mineral ore storage bay.

318
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
Set to go off at noon.

319
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,680
Just 60 seconds.

320
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,120
Supposed to be fixing this door,
so let's look busy, yeah?

321
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,360
Mm-hmm.

322
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,720
All fixed now, Hol.

323
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,080
Just for the record,
I heard every word you said in there.

324
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,560
Dozy wazzock, gormless gimp.
Everything.

325
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,280
What about stupid bald git?

326
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,840
You didn't say that in there.

327
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,320
No, but I'm saying it now.

328
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,000
An EMP? I know your plan.

329
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,160
It's not happening.

330
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,240
Oh, really? And where's Kryten?

331
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
He's in the MOS.

332
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,480
Detonating a meteorite
to create electromagnetic energy

333
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,200
to take out the ship's grid at noon.

334
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,200
Which is precisely ten seconds from now,

335
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,120
and there ain't a damn thing
you can do to stop him, baldy!

336
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
Tonight's the night.

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,640
Not tonight, Krytes. Now!

338
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,320
You said 12am, sir.

339
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,760
12am. Noon.

340
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,520
But 12am is midnight, sir.

341
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,080
Is it? I thought 12am was noon.

342
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,480
No, that's 12pm, sir.

343
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
Oh!

(BEEPING)

345
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,000
The mineral ore storage bay
is now sealed off until further notice.

346
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,960
Also, your seven-day leaving period
has been reduced to seven minutes.

- (BEEPING)
- What we gonna do now?

348
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,800
We have to take Starbug
and find a new ship.

349
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,680
Oh, screw your head on, Kryten.
We haven't passed a ship in yonks.

350
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,840
That's not strictly true.
In fact, we passed one yesterday.

351
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,600
We did? Why didn't you tell us, sir?

352
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
I did, Kryten. I told you.

353
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,000
- Oh, come on.
- I knew I needed a service.

354
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,760
If we fire up the burners, we can
catch that ship in a couple of days.

358

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,080
Don't say it's big.

360
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,680
It is big. It's really big.

in fact.

362

in our fridge,

363

- (BEEPING)
- Wait, I'm getting something!

365
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,360
Oh, I don't think it's the ship that
passed Red Dwarf, it's something else.

366
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,200
Some kind of deep-space
reconnaissance ship.

367
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,920
Handshaking now.

368
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,320
The ship is called the Iron Star

369
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
and was built several hundred years
after Red Dwarf

370
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,400
with, presumably, all that brings
in technological advances.

371
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,480
If this ship's in decent nick,
we could've struck gold here.

372
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,240
This could be our new home.

373
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,040
I'll download the Iron Star's floor plan
and show you round.

374
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,680
Iron Star.

375
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,120
Obviously needs some TLC,

376
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,200
but it's the perfect ship for those crews
looking for a project.

377
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
And most importantly,
there's no forward chain.

378
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
The AAR is now complete.

379
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,480
It is now safe to remove helmets.

380
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,840
How come Helmet-head
gets to stay on Starbug?

381
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,880

RIMMER: What is that place?

389
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,520
I believe it's their hologram projection
suite, sir.

390
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,760
It looks like the Iron Star was able
to sustain multiple holograms.

391
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,680
They had tech way in advance
of anything on Red Dwarf.

392
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,720
Yeah, it doesn't look like you have
to wind up anything round here.

393
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
So how'd they do it?

394
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,280
A form of quantum energy
known as diamond light.

395
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,720
It enables holograms
to have unimaginable powers.

396
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,680
I'll be right down!

What's this?

399
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,920
It creates a force field around food
you've elected not to eat.

400
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,880
Must be some kind of slimming aid.

401
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,640
It's on the no-meat vegan setting.

402
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,080
Smart cutlery. No thanks.

403
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,680
I like me cutlery stupid.

404
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,640
So what does this tech do?
Can it upgrade my light bee?

405
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
Well, according to the notes,

406
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,480
it gives holograms the ability
to manipulate light in all its forms.

407
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
What the hell does that mean?

408
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,680
I'm not exactly sure.

409
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,400
I suggest we take the tech back to Starbug

410
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,040
and conduct further tests
before we embark on an untested pathway.

411
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,960
I'm not waiting while you conduct

412
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,520
your namby-pamby European Space Agency
safety tests,

413

with me having to go before a committee
of meddling grey-suited bureau-droids

414
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,720
and answer multiple-choice questions on
where I'm most likely to find a croissant.

415
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,040
I'll take my chances now,
thank you so much.

416
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,720
But sir, this is technology
we're unfamiliar with.

417
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,680
We need more time
to evaluate if it's safe!

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,200
Kryten, I want the upgrade now,
and that's an order.

Are you sure this is safe?

Perhaps I'm over-worrying, sir.

423
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
After all,
what's the worst that can happen?

I'm up to ten already.

443
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,480
I can change objects into light,

444
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,280
and transfer them back
to their solid state again.

What happened?

458
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,200
As you know, we chose not to carry out
European Space Agency safety checks.

459
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,760
As a consequence,
the power surge has fried your battery.

460
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,160
Your light bee won't hold any charge.
Uh-uh!

461
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,040
The only way of powering you up now
is from an independent power source.

462
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,080
I'm plugged in?!

463
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,040
Well, without being plugged in, you have
just a few minutes of charge time left.

464
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,480
From Glitter Guy to the Cable Kid.

465
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,560
And once your charge is spent,

466
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,280
it's almost certain
you'll shut down permanently.

467
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Though I'm not getting my hopes up.

468
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,600
Why on earth did we do the transfer

469
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,800
without carrying out
the proper safety tests?

470
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,760
Well, because you ordered me not to, sir.

471
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,840
Yes, but why did you listen to me?

472
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,000
You know I often don't know
what I'm talking about,

473
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,880
and when I don't,
it's your job to say something.

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,480

00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,680
No-one special. A nobody, really.

517
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,720
Come on, guys, back me up here.

518
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,160
- Well, he's a nobody.
- He's less than nobody.

519
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,200
An absolute zero.

520
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,000
It's as we always imagined. Truly humble.

521
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,640
You have been such an inspiration
to us, Holy Poppadom,

522
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,880
as our society fell to the Ferals
and their tyrannical regime.

523
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,800
- Ferals?
- Cats,

524
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,360
like you and I, brother,

525
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,680
but vain and shallow creatures
who share nothing

526
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,960
and care about nobody but themselves.

527
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,600
There are people out there like that?

528
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,200
But fear not, Holy Poppadom,
for we have stolen the Anubis Stone...

529
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,680
...which holds untold powers
to whoever possesses it.

530
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,320
Anubis? Who's he?

531
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,680
A creature with the head of a cat
who embalmed the dead.

532
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,200
According to the scriptures,
he who possesses the sacred stone

533
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,080
shall fend off his enemies
and lead his people to the promised land.

534
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,640
What is it?

535
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,480
On first look, I thought
it was serendibite,

536
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,200
one of the most precious minerals
in the universe.

537
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,440
But on closer inspection,

538
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,120
I realised it's varnished beetle dung.

539
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,800
Not so precious, then.

540
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,960
It is to them.

541
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,280
We are so blessed to have
finally met our Holy Poppadom.

OK.

- (GASPS) A sermon!

A sermon in the corridor!

558
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
All right. Years ago...

559
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,720
Er, sir, may I have a word?

560
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,680
What, now? One minute, guys.

561
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,240
You can't tell them the truth.

562
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,760
But I have to.

563
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,920
These nutters think I'm their god.

564
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,480
Sir, if you tell them the truth,

565
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,200
you'll break their hearts
and crush their souls.

566
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Oh, you're right. Have to
play along. Act like a god.

567
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,560
Act like a god?
You've scarcely mastered human.

568
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,520
Well, they surely won't be with us
for long. What harm can it do?

- (BEEPING)
- Oh, what's this?

570
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,080
Energy signature, incoming.

571
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,800
Some kind of boarding party beaming in.

572
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,440
- Hey, cat buds, are you being followed?
- The Ferals!

573
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,040
They're here, and they will not rest
until we have meowed our last.

574
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,240
We beseech you, Holy Poppadom,
protect us.

575
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,200
Hang on. How do we know
they're not bait?

576
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Bait? Who's the fish?

577
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,800
Look in the mirror and do this.

578
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,520
You know what? I've gotta help them.
After all, they are my followers.

579
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,960
My friends, be not afraid.

580
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,720
Follow me.

581
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,560
"Be not afraid"?

582
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,080
This god lark's gone straight to his head.

583
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,000
No, it be this way.

So it's you who shelter

Who the hell are you?

588
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,080
I am the Commander of the Armies
of the Feral Guards.

Feral King,

591
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,680
Where is the Anubis Stone?

592
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,040
Come on now, give it up.

593
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,200
Or you shall die.

594
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,280
And after you're dead,

595
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,600
we will present your bloody corpses
to our people as a gift.

596
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,040

often hits the mark, too.

598
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,880
If it's OK with everyone,
I'd like to go ninth.

599
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,400
Challenge! Cat traitor.

600
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,840
Whore man.

601
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
Bitch of the people.

602
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,120
How comes this guy can't stand me?

603
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,880
He's only known me for 20 seconds.

604
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,280
He's probably just saving time.

605
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,520
You can't harm anyone any more, Rodon.
Look who is with us. Cloister,

606
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,320
the god of our people.

607
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
That be I.

608
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,200
God who has created nothing
but hate and division and war and death.

609
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,880
I've done some other stuff too.

610
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,440
If I allow you to live,

611
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,200
my sovereignty would dribble
through my fingers

612
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,040
like fine grains of kitty litter.

613
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,760
You must die.

614
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,520
- Look, what is it that you guys want?
- The Anubis Stone.

615
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
Ah. Well, we had that.

616
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,520
We... We did have it,
but, er, then we lost it.

617
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Didn't we, my followers?

618
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,480
No, we didn't. It is here.

619
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,080
And now we are protected
by our Holy Poppadom,

620
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,560
we will never give up the stone.

621
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,480
- Never.
- Ever.

622
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,560
Get the stone.

623
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,800
Me, my Feral King?

624
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,280
You are my royal aide, aren't you?

625
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm... I'm more of a food
and dining services sort of aide...

626
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,120
Having trouble putting on a bow tie -

627
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,360
that's not me.

628
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,160
Getting mystical stones off people's
not really me either.

629
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,000
- Get the stone.
- Right away, my Feral King.

630
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,920
Try and take the stone,
and Cloister's wrath will be vented.

631
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,480
Hail will rain down.

632
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,040
Plagues unleashed.

633
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,320
Men will be turned into slabs of salt.

634
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,520
Yeah, not just normal salt,
like low-sodium sea salt.

635
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,560
Go get the goddamn stone!

636
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,320
On my way. Here I go.

637
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,320
Excuse me, sorry. Coming through.

Nice to meet you.

Sorry. Sorry, coming through.

00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,560
Watch what happens now as they defy
the will of our Holy Poppadom.

641
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,680
Flush 'em out of an airlock.

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Let the Cat People witness
the consequences

643
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,880
of questioning my sovereignty.

Vegan forks!
They won't let us stab meat!

647
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,360
We can only stab tofu
and processed meat substitutes!

648
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,160
Sir! Some lettuce! Catch!

649
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,480
Ah, not so confident now, are you?

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,000
Ah.

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,720
OK. I'm dropping the lettuce.

But, my Alpha,
two of your party are still on board.

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,320
Send fish to their mamas.

661
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,120
Launch the meow missiles.

662
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,120
Now!

Ow!

665

I'm unplugged.
I've only got a minute or so left.

666

Have faith.

675
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,160
- We need to get to Starbug.
- We'll use the lift.

676
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,640
But you're not supposed
to use lifts at times like this!

677
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,040
No, that's just fires. When you're on
disintegrating spaceships, no-one minds.

Something's caught us!

684

It's debris hitting
the stern section, sir.

685
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,080
We're on fire. The ship is on fire.

686
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,560
It's heat from the fuel tanks.
We're going to explode.

687
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,840
No choice.
Stand by for module separation.

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,400
Uncoupling now!

689
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,920

690
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,520
Excellent quick thinking, Listy.
Just one question.

00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,840
How are you proposing to fly
what remains of the ship

692
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,360
when all the engines
are in the bit you've just ejected?

693
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
I'm probably worrying needlessly,
I know.

694
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,280
To be honest, I didn't have an amazing
amount of time

695
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,640
- to go through every option.
- You mean like use a fire extinguisher?

696
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Use a fire extinguisher!
That could've worked too.

697
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,080
I just thought at the time, "Ship's
on fire. Get rid of the fiery bit."

698
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,720
Get rid of the fiery bit,
worry about the fly-ey bit later?

699
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,480
Tomorrow's another day.

700
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,040
Unfortunately, we need to get past today
to get to tomorrow,

701
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,400
and it's the today part of your
whizzo escape plan that concerns me.

702
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,840
Kryten, what's our present flight path?

703
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,640
It's down, sir.

704
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,800
Could you possibly be a bit more specific?

705
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,040
Well, it's straight down, sir.

706
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,200
Heading for that desert moon
that's directly below us.

707
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,560
Anyone know how to land a cockpit?

708
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,040
There'll be a way. Kryten will know.

709
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,960
He always knows about stuff like this.

710
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,040
Not absolutely always, sir,
as I'm about to prove.

711
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,040
How come you don't know? I thought
you were meant to be a major astro.

712
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,920
That's the predictive text misspell
for what he is.

713
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,560
Well, what are we gonna do?

714
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,120
The owner's manual.
Look for the owner's manual.

715
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,160
You'll find it with the service history
and the MOT.

716
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,360
Is this it?

717
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,680
- Oh, this is interesting.
- What?

718
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,960
Apparently, the infotainment touch screen
has a pinch-to-zoom feature

719
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,320
and delivers the richest
audiovisual entertainment

720
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,760
in any low-budget ship-to-planet
transport vehicle to date.

721
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,040
Who knew that?

722
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,640
Look, we're entering the upper atmosphere.

723
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,880
The ship's not slowing down.
The atmosphere's too thin.

724
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,200
"Landing."

725
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,160
Got it. 247.

726
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,800
43, 45, 47.

727
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,800
"Launch parachute."

728
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,400
- Parachute?
- Launching parachute.

729
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,120
Launching parachute!

730
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
Where's the parachute?
There's no parachute. It's not here.

731
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,120
How can it not be here?

732
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,640
Er, is the parachute that, er,
big shiny fluffy piece of material

733
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,240
with coloured stripes?

734
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,520
You removed the emergency parachute
to make yourself a Puffa jacket?

735
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,840
Not just a Puffa.
I got a pair of mittens out of it, too!

736
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,040
It was silk.
What did you want me to do?

737
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
Relax, sirs, there's an emergency backup.

738
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,840
Is there? Or is the backup parachute
now hanging in your wardrobe

739
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,680
next to your leather jacket
made out of the ejector seats?

740
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,440
When have I ever had two suits the same?

741
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,280
I used one parachute.

742
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,640
Launching parachute.

743
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,520
(WHUP!)

744
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,320
Retros on.

745
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,960
Touchdown in five seconds.
Brace for impact.

746
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,080
(ALL GASP)

747
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,840
Starbug has landed.

748
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,480
- Permission to go into apeshit mode.
- Permission granted.

749
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,520
(ALL CHEER)

750
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,160
What now?

751
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,480
Oh, we've gotta take stock.
Food, water, fuel. What have we got?

752
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,080
Food - none.

753
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,800
Water - none.

754
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,240
Fuel...

755
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,080
(PRESSES BUTTONS)

756
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,640
...none.

757
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,120
My Alpha, I'm sorry to interrupt you
knocking things off a table,

758
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,400
but an escape ship has been detected
fleeing from the Iron Star.

759
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,920
There's every reason to suspect
it is piloted by the humans.

760
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,800
Also, worryingly, the Anubis Stone

761
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,880
appears to be nothing more than
varnished beetle dung.

762
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,200
So they still have the real Anubis Stone.

763
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,000
Find them.

764
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,320
My Alpha.

765
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,240
A fresh scratching post, my King.

766
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,560
So, after cleverly jettisoning the engines
and all the ship's fuel,

767
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,560
very much looking forward
to Listy's screw-up part deux.

768
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,120
Look, there's no need to panic. I've been
in holes before and got out of it.

769
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,840
Remember that radiation leak on Red Dwarf?

770
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,960
It killed the entire crew, including me.

771
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,000
But I got out of it.

772
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,440
Proving my point.

773
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,520
Sorry to disturb you. We just wanted to
congratulate you on your expert landing.

774
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,680
You know, when the ship was on fire,
some of us...

775
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,240
...were starting to have doubts,

776
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,320
but we knew you would save us, HP.
You are truly amazing.

777
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,400
Aww, you guys.
What are these ragamuffins like, eh?

778
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,200
So what's your plan now,
Holy Poppadom?

779
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,720
Create another amazing miracle so we can
escape and find The Promised Land?

780
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,800
Working on it now, Sister Luna.

781
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,120
Got lots of ideas floating round
the almighty brain box.

782
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Just wanna come up with
something truly special.

783
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,560
Oh, can't wait.

784
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,800
Neither can we.

785
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,640
Anyway, erm, I've gotta get on.
Anything else?

786
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,800
Yeah, one question. Giving birth -
why did you make it hurt?

787
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,800
And why did you make babies cry at night
rather than just during the day

788
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
- when everyone's awake?
- Yeah.

789
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,800
- That's two questions.
- Oh, I got one.

790
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,480
Why do we have to bathe?

791
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,280
Wouldn't it be easier
just to make us all non-stick?

792
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,160
And, erm, how come
we can't turn our head 360 degrees?

793
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Wouldn't that have made reversing
a bit easier?

794
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,920
And-and-and male genitals -
did you... Did you run out of time?

795
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,640
Look, all good questions,
terrific questions,

796
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,800
but I've gotta get on. I'm really busy.

797
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,560
I've gotta save us, and then there's a
whole bunch of people I've gotta forgive,

798
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,920
- So, you know...
- Of course, of course.

799
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,160
We must leave you to create
your next miracle of wonderment.

800
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,560
Exactly.

801
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,720
What am I going to do?

802
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,680
They're relying on me!

803
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,480
Er, sir, a thought occurs.

804
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,920
If we crash-landed, perhaps
some of the Iron Star crash-landed too.

805
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,458
So?

806
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:53,560
Well, so if we can find some of the debris,
maybe it can offer us a way off this rock.

807
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,440
Wait, the Iron Star
had working teleporters, right?

808
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,680
- Precisely.
- We're in two-thirds of a spaceship

809
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,040
with no fuel.
How are we supposed to find this debris?

810
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,400
Well, I'll... I'll read the owner's
manual, see if I can find anything.

811
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,560
Oh, this is interesting!

812
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,560
Don't tell me. The heated seats
have a massage function.

813
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,240
You've read it too?

814
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,840
(FAINTLY) # Lister, David Lister
Lister, Listy

815
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,120
# Lister, Listy

816
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,240
# Lister, David Lister
Lister, Listy... #

817
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,000
Listen to them! I can't bear this.

818
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,800
Gonna have to tell them
who I really am.

819
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,440
But sir, while they believe in you,
they have hope.

820
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,520
If you tell them the truth,
it will destroy them.

821
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,840
You're right. I can't tell them.

822
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,000
You've got to.

823
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,640
Me? Why me?

824
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,720
- It'll be better coming from you.
- How so?

825
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,320
I won't have to be there.

826
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,480
Be there to see the silent disappointment
in their eyes.

827
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,040
Remembering your history with women,

828
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,520
I'd have thought
you'd be immune to that by now.

829
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,280
Have you finished?

830
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,560
Was said by no woman to you.

831
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,240
As I'm a god, I forgive you for that.

832
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,080
What's the point of telling them?
What's in it for us?

833
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,240
It's not about us, Rimmer,
it's about them.

834
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,640
They're relying on me to pull
some supernatural wonder

835
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,440
out of me magic miracle box.

836
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,080
If they knew the truth,
at least they'd stop depending on me

837
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,000
and start thinking for themselves.

838
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,040
I've never thought for myself,
and it's never done me any harm.

839
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,840
But you're dead.

840
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,520
Dead because you didn't question
the order to repair

841
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,800
an unrepairable drive plate.
You didn't think for yourself.

842
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,960
My body may be dead,
but my personality was resurrected

843
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,160
to act as a hologrammatic mentor to you.

844
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,920
And do you know why, out of
the entire crew, I was selected to return?

845
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,280
Yeah - Holly was nuts.

846
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,960
Because I never think for myself,
I obey orders, and I always carry a pen.

847
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,800
That's a creed I've lived by
my whole life.

848
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,400
It's a creed that takes you places.

849
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,920
Yeah - straight through
the cremation curtain and into an urn.

850
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,160
Thinking for yourself
is surely the greatest lesson of all.

851
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,800
That's why I taught it to you, Krytes.

852
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,200
It transformed my life

853
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,200
and allowed me to become so much more
than just a sanitation droid.

854
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,240
And it could do the same
for these nutjobs.

855
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,120
So go on, get out there,
tell 'em who I really am.

856
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,800
I have some bad news.
I think you should all sit down.

857
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,280
Oh, you are. Oh.

858
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,000
Well, perhaps sit down and hold on, then.

859
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,560
Right, here goes.

860
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,400
Mr Lister...

861
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,720
There's something you should know.

862
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,920
You see, well, the thing is...

863
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,960
(EMOTIONALLY) He's the most wonderful,
amazing man I've ever met!

864
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,760
I absolutely adore him!

865
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,080
I thought I should put you straight
on that.

866
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,400
Oh!

867
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,360
How'd it go? Did you tell them?

868
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,600
After everything you've done for me, sir,
I just couldn't.

869
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,440
I'll go again.

870
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,000
I must apologise.

871
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,600
Er, last time, I told you Mr Lister was
the most wonderful, amazing man.

872
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,320
That's not quite the whole picture.

873
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,680
In fact, he's staggeringly incredible
and stupendous too!

874
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,160
Yeus... De-doh!

875
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,960
You tell them!
I'm hopeless at telling them.

876
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,320
What's the problem?

877
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,600
I just can't bring myself
to criticise you, sir.

878
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,840
Well, someone's gotta tell 'em.

879
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,920
I'm a cat, they're cats.

880
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,800
Let me take care of this.

881
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,800
Yo, buds.

882
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,600
What is it with you guys?

883
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,080
That guy in there ain't your god.

884
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,760
He ain't nobody.

885
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,040
Did he not go into stasis
and save the mother of our people?

886
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,080
Well...OK, he did that.

887
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Did he not refuse to betray her
to the authorities and now we live?

888
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,200
Well, OK, he did that too.

889
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,520
And did he not give me the power of speech
when before I had no such gift?

890
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,560
# David Lister

891
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,680
# Lister, Listy
Lister, Listy

892
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,160
# Lister

893
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,480
# David Lister
Lister, Listy

894
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,640
# Lister, Listy
Lister, Listy

895
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,480
# Lister, Listy

896
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,840
# Lister

897
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,160
# Lister, Listy

898
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,000
# Lister, Listy, Lister... #

899
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,920
They've converted him!

900
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,680
Why can no-one criticise me?

901
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,440
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

902
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,640
I once did a course
in the art of breaking bad news.

903
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,480
I came top of the class.

904
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,600
I was particularly proud of
one of the simulation scenarios

905
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,520
where I had to tell a man
who'd just regained consciousness

906
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,440
that the emergency rescue team
hadn't found his penis.

907
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,480
Although, sadly, his dog had.

908
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,600
Kryten, watch and learn!

909
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,120
Right, you lot.
I'm cutting straight to the chase.

910
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
You've devoted your lives

911
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,560
- to worshipping a feckless...
- (DULL THUD)

912
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,040
A piece of debris has landed!

913
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,560
Thank you, Holy Poppadom.

914
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,880
- We are truly blessed.
- Another miracle.

915
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,760
How is a huge chunk of crashed spaceship

916
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,920
hurtling towards us
at 1,000mph a miracle?

917
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,920
- 'Tis not for us to question.
- I think it probably is.

918
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,920
Too late!

919
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,240
- Aargh!
- Argh!

920
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,000
Ah!

921
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,360
There may be working teleporters on there.

922
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,760
Did you know the landing retros swivel

923
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,600
and can be used as a makeshift hovercraft?

924
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,040
That's all very well,
but we don't have any fuel.

925
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,360
Well, according to the manual,
Starbug is a hybrid, sir.

926
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,920
We can switch to electric.

927
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,720
Then what are we waiting for?

928
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,480
Hovercraft mode. Engaging now.

929
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,040
Guys, go strap yourselves back in.

930
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,720
(WAGGLES SWITCH)

931
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Nothing's happening.

932
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,240
Well, it's electric. It doesn't make any
engine noise, sir. It's already started.

933
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,720
OK, let's go.

934
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,920
How much charge have we got?

935
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,920
- According to the readouts, 57%, sir.
- Excellent.

936
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,280
However, as we don't know
how long our journey might take,

937
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,160
to conserve power
I suggest we travel on eco mode.

938
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,920
I hope you're paying attention, Lister.

939
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,480
Here is someone with a brain
larger than a pea

940
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,760
coming up with a rescue strategy
that's thought through and intelligent.

941
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,880
I also suggest we turn off
all non-essential electricals.

942
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,400
You mean me?

943
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,320
Not just you, sir.
There's the air conditioning,

944
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,240
the lights, the seat warmers.

945
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,240
And where do I come on this list?

946
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,080
Above seat warmers but below air con?

947
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,360
Are you outta your mind?
We need those seat warmers.

948
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,280
The desert gets chilly at night.

949
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,560
Er, sir, could I suggest
you enter low-power mode?

950
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,360
Low-power mode. I hate low-power mode.

951
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,000
My vision's standard def,

952
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,480
I can only hear in mono,

953
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,000
and when there's electronic interference,
I wind up looking all snowy.

954
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,040
But it's the only way to preserve
what's left of Starbug's charge, sir.

955
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,520
(SIGHS)

956
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,480
(POWERS DOWN)

957
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,480
Wow, look at him. He looks like
an old movie you don't wanna watch.

958
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,840
OK, no need to say anything.

959
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,040
But this is freaky, bud.

960
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,720
It's like seeing a tortoise
without its shell.

961
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,600
(CRACKLY) Er, hello, I'm here.
I can hear all this.

962
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,880
But he's not real, is he? You forget.

963
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,720
I am real. Of course I'm real!

964
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,640
Yeah, but you're not really real,
you're dead.

965
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,200
This really brings it home.

966
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,600
You're creeping me out.

967
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,280
As the French philosopher
René Descartes once said,

968
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,240
"I think, therefore I am."

969
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,000
"Je pense, donc je...

970
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,000
"..am."

971
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,040
But you don't think, do ya?

972
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,400
Guys, guys, come on.

973
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,880
Of course I think.
What are you talking about?

974
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,440
No, you don't.
You don't decide what you do.

975
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,880
The computer in your light bee
does all your thinking for you.

976
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,280
There's no actual you
to think or not think anything.

977
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,080
Oh, sir, please!
Can you stop being so...

978
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,440
- ...catty?
- Grr!

979
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,320
There's no actual me
to think or not think anything?

980
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,920
I've never actually thought about that.

981
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,840
I haven't got free will, then, have I?

982
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,360
So it's not, "I think, therefore I am."

983
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,360
It's, "The computer thinks,
therefore I think I am."

984
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
I've never actually
thought about that before.

985
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,120
And you're not thinking about it now.

986
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,120
It's your light bee making you think
you're thinking about it.

987
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:14,600
- Cat, man, back the smeg off. OK?
- I don't actually exist, then, do I?

988
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,840
You see what you've done, sir?

989
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,680
You've put Mr Rimmer
in existential crisis mode.

990
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,120
And look! The added anxiety
is consuming more of our battery!

991
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,520
Guys, if we're gonna get through this,
we need to stick together.

992
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,520
What's the point? We're screwed.

993
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,920
Well, I'm not. I don't exist.

994
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,800
- (MEOW!)
- (EXPLOSION)

995
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,240
What the hell was that?!

996
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,680
The Ferals - they've found us.

997
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,160
(MEOW!)

998
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,120
(MEOW!)

999
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,440
Fire everything we have!

1000
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,560
(MEOW!)

1001
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,360
From the heat signature,
it's one ship coming in at six o'clock.

1002
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,680
Open the sunroof.

1003
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,160
There's no point.
I forgot to bring my surrender flag.

1004
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,040
I take it everywhere with me, and on
the one day I think I won't need it...

1005
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,080
(MEOW!)

1006
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,640
We're not surrendering.
Cat, stand on the chair

1007
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,920
and start blasting
out the emergency escape hatch.

1008
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,160
Wait, more trouble
coming in from port side.

1009
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,800
I'm getting it too, sir.
It's a sandstorm.

1010
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,360
A 4.9 on the Stanley scale.

1011
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,680
Three miles high and 60 miles wide.

1012
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,200
Not according to this.
It's 6.3 on the Stanley scale

1013
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,360
- and it's coming on the starboard side.
- Is it possible

1014
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,840
we could be looking at two sandstorms,

1015
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,560
both heading towards us
from opposite sides?

1016
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,040
We're gonna be the filling
in a sandstorm sandwich.

1017
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,000
Kryten, likely outcome if we get hit?

1018
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,320
Paintwork damage

1019
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,840
and front panel replacement
required on both sides, sir.

1020
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,040
- What about cover?
- Getting insured at this point

1021
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,520
ain't gonna solve anything.

1022
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,920
Cover from the sandstorms,
you brainless cretin.

1023
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,400
To answer your question,

1024
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,720
the nearest cover
is the debris up ahead, sir.

1025
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,800
- Can we reach it in time?
- I don't believe we can.

1026
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,200

We're flat-out, full power.

00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,840
Have you lost your mind?

1034
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,920
A couple of miles in, we'll kill
all power. They'll never find us.

1035
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,320
They'll never find us
because we'll be sandstorm soup!

1036
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,720
There could be a tornado
of debris parts in there.

1037
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,240
Have you got a better idea?

1038
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,480
Lister, fly into the sandstorm.
And that's an order.

00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,040
Ohh. Nothing to do now but just
to sit tight and wait for it to blow over.

1042
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,280
How long's that gonna take?
Could be days.

1043
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,200
I'm wondering
if I'm doing the right thing.

1044
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,480
- What d'you mean?
- Hanging on.

1045
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,560
Draining Starbug's battery.

1046
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,680
Maybe it would be better if I just pulled
my own plug and be done with it.

you'd be dead.

I'm already dead.

Why am I here?
What's the point of me?

1050
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,040
The only reason I was ever brought back

1051
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,480
was because I was
diametrically opposite to you.

1052
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,440
I don't fit in. No-one likes me.

who likes me.

Oh, come on, I'm not getting
into a naming contest, Rimmer.

1056
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,520
But there's... people
on board that... like you.

1057
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,200
- Name one.
- Oh, come on.

Name one!

01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,200
OK... Erm, what about Skutter on B Deck?
He likes you.

1060
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,400
The one who's mental?
The one who eats shoes?

1061
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,760
He still likes you.

1062
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,920
Erm..

1063
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,320
That dispenser on C Deck,

- Kryten?
- Kryten does not like me.

But he still likes you. Admires you, even.

He told me he liked and admired you
just the other day.

1069
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,480
Yeah? What did he say?

1070
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,760
That he liked and admired you -
just the other day.

1071
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,880

- Really.

We're in the middle of something.

1076

Lister was saying you like and admire me,
Kryten. Is that true?

1077
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,000
- Look, he nodded.
- He didn't move.

1078
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,000
That was a proper nod.

I think I'll go and change heads.

I need you.

01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,800

Rimmer, you're the other one.

1105
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,600
I'm the "other one"?

1106
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,520
You do all the stuff
that the other one does.

1107
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,760
- And what's that, then?
- "Other one" stuff.

1108
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,120
"Other one" stuff?
What's "other one" stuff?

1109

All the stuff that the others haven't done
that the other one does.

1110
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,480
I'm pointless.

No, you're not.

1112

You know, I'll tell you the point of you.

1113

A moon cannot make light, right?

1114
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,920
And yet there's such a thing as moonlight.

1115
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,640
It's light reflected off a moon
from a sun.

1116
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,600
Yeah, but the sun can't make moonlight
without the moon.

1117
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,240
And the moon can't make moonlight
without the sun.

1118
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,640
So who's making the moonlight?

1119
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,200
They both are.

1120
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:41,840
Which means that, even though a moon
cannot make light, moonlight exists.

1121

to be possible, sir.

- Well, the sandstorm has buried us alive.

01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,240
Are you sure?
Has anyone been outside to check?

1132
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,840
If we could get outside to check,
we wouldn't be buried alive.

We'd just be parked in a large hole.

If it's only a couple of feet,

maybe we could force open

as it's possible to be!

How could this have happened?

1163
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,120
Well, it happened
because of a random act of kindness

1164
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:34,040
when you refused to allow
your pet cat to be put down,

1165

but created a new species.

- Me.
- And me.

01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,080
over the three million years
he was alone in deep space.

1193
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,040
I'll become as brilliant
as he must've been.

1194
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,160
An intellectual colossus.

1195
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,000
Exactly.

1196
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,880
I accept your suggestion.

1197
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,640
But if he does that,

1198
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,840
won't he wind up crazier
than a dog that just got bathed?

1199
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,840
If he's back to his original self,
he'll know who we are and help us.

1200
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,560
Downloading backup files.

1201
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,160
What's going on?

1202
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,880
I feel a bit funny.

1203
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,960
What's happening?

1204
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,680
What's happening, dudes?

1205
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,360
(ALL CHEER)

1206
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,640
We're stranded on this moon
in Starbug, Hol.

1207
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:01,320
No water, no food, no supplies.
Is there any way to get out?

1208
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,800
Have you considered opening the door?

1209
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,680
We're buried alive
under a sandstorm, Holly.

1210
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,920
Gotcha.

1211
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,400
Let me run some deep analysis
probability-based event scenarios.

1212
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,480
I'll be back when I've done it

1213
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,680
Right, I've done it.

1214
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,440
So soon? That's amazing.

1215
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,360
I'm not pretending this is gonna be easy,

1216
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,920
and I have to get the calculations
Just right.

1217
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,240
OK, what's the plan?

1218
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,960
I take one of Red Dwarf's
thermonuclear mining torpedoes

1219
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,000
and I blow up the moon.

1220
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,040
And you'll be thrown clear in the blast.

1221
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,520
Is that safe?

1222
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,720
I'm miles away. I'll be fine.

1223
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,400
No. Is it safe for us?

1224
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,160
Well, I'm no expert,
but I wouldn't have thought so, no.

1225
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,240
Look, Holly, I know
we're in a tight spot here,

1226
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,280
but I don't want you to do anything crazy.

1227
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,160
It's a bit late saying that now.

1228
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,480
What d'you mean?

1229
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,200
Well, I've already fired off the torpedo.

1230
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,640
Impact in less than 60 seconds.

1231
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,760
Are you sure that was wise, Holly?

1232
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,200
I've done all the computation analysis.

1233
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,680
Taken into consideration the exact point
of impact, the depth of explosion,

1234
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,480
the weight of the ship,
texture of the desert,

1235
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,120
the moon's gravity.

1236
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,120
And I think I've got everything
absolutely spot on.

1237
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,720
Oh, no, I missed.

1238
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,320
You missed the moon?!

1239
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,160
Maybe my calculations
weren't as spot-on as I thought.

1240
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,600
How's that happened?

1241
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,480
I think it's to do with
the nine times table.

1242
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,960
It's... It's never been my favourite,
that one.

1243
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,120
God help us all.

1244
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,800
There, that should fix it.
I'll have another go.

1245
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,000
Here we go.

1246
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,920
How do you know this'll be any better?

1247
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,360
Well, this one's definitely
gonna hit the moon,

1248
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,960
so at least it won't be as embarrassing
as the last one.

1249
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,960
Yeah, but will it be better for us?

1250
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,960
Depends on whether
you get blown up or not.

1251
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,600
And if you do, how you take it.

1252
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,040
A lot of people get quite shirty.

1253
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,200
Here it comes.

1254
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,680
(ALL YELL)

1255
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,440
(CRASHING AND BANGING)

1256
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,880
(CRASHING AND BANGING CONTINUES)

1257
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,160
Hoo! The best miracle yet, Holy Poppadom.
What a truly wondrous day!

1258
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,200
Just thought I'd check in.

1259
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,120
Did anyone survive?

1260
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,880
We all did, Hol.

1261
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,400
No way!

1262
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,760
- How did you survive?
- You saved us.

1263
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,680
That actually worked, then?

1264
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,120
That's a miracle, that is.

1265
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,040
Anything else I can help you with today?

1266
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,240
Yeah, get us back to Red Dwarf,
will you, Hol?

1267
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,640
I'll come and get you.

1268
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,840
- Hey!
- Yeah!

1269
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,520
Come, my followers,
let our hearts sing on this joyous day.

1270
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,680
Yeah!

1271
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,560
# Lister, David Lister

1272
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,440
# Lister, Listy
Lister, Listy

1273
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,880
# Lister, David Lister... #

1274
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,600
Suggest you plug into me, sir,
until we can get you powered up again.

1275
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,320
Let's get Red Dwarf the hell out of here.

1276
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,160
Holly, why didn't you tell us
the Ferals were onboard?

1277
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,400
Were they holding you hostage?

1278
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,600
No.

1279
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,080
I just forgot.

1280
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,880
You cannot defeat us, Rodon.

1281
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,720
Our Holy Poppadom
will always repel our enemies.

1282
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,720
- At least that's what the scriptures say.
- (GROWLS)

1283
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,400
Maybe I missed the small print.

1284
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,320
Uhh!

1285
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,360
Let's test these scriptures now,
shall we... Sister?

1286
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,800
Tell me where the real Anubis Stone is.

1287
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,680
Or watch her die.

1288
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,080
We don't know where it is.

1289
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,880
You're Cloister. You know everything.

1290
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,200
I'm not. I'm not Cloister.

1291
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,920
I mean, you guys think I'm your god

1292
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,240
because I once saved a cat
from being put down

1293
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,320
and her kittens eventually
evolved into you guys.

1294
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,400
Cloister's just a mushed-up version
of Lister

1295
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:43,120
in the same way everything I did got
mushed up and wound up as sacred writing.

1296
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,560
Well, if you're not Cloister,

1297
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,680
then who the hell are you?

1298
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,200
I'm a chicken-soup
vending-machine repairman.

1299
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:56,960
You're... You're in charge
of repairing soup machines?

1300
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,800
I wasn't actually in charge. I was...

1301
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,360
Second in charge.

1302
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,280
Technically, Rimmer was in charge.

1303
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,120
So what did you do, then?

1304
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,640
He pushed the trolley.

1305
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,400
And recommended
what pipe cleaner he should use.

1306
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,040
Like a golfer has a caddy.

1307
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,400
I was like the caddy
for the chicken-soup repairman.

1308
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,800
So Rimmer would be like, er,
"Pass me a 14B,"

1309
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,640
and I'd be like, "Hold on, Rimmer,

1310
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,600
"the air con's on cold and we're getting
a breeze coming in from the lifts.

1311
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,120
"That clogged-up nozzle could be iced up.
Forget the 14B, mate.

1312
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,720
"I think you'll need a 14D."

1313
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,920
But the miracles - the shipquake
swallowing up the Feral guards,

1314
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,520
the debris landing in the desert,

1315
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,760
being trapped underground in the sandstorm
and then being thrown clear?

1316
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,360
Just flukes, or coincidence,

1317
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,800
or good fortune, or...

1318
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,360
...science.

1319
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,440
So you're not the god of our people?

1320
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,440
No.

1321
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,760
- And they're not your disciples?
- Hell, no!

1322
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,960
- You're just a ship of fools.
- Yes!

1323
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,960
No.

1324
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,240
No, you're not a ship of fools.

1325
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,560
The only fools here are us.

1326
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,760
No. But... what about me?
You gave me the gift of speech.

1327
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,200
I think with you it's just psychosomatic.

1328
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,360
You believed in me, so you could speak.

1329
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,800
Now I don't.

1330
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,480
So I c-c-c...

1331
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,880
Eh...

1332
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,400
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)

1333
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,120
I've wasted my entire life.

1334
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,360
Chasing a false prophet.

1335
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,240
And a stone made of beetle dung.

1336
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,840
- Our time here is done.
- What of your brother?

1337
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,560
What, the little pink furry shag-bandit
is my brother?

1338
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,040
We have checked the records.
It is truly him.

1339
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,000
My brother was younger than me.

1340
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,280
I've had a hard life!
I ain't no king like you.

1341
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,960
One time I nearly had to work!

1342
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,000
The worry - it ages you!

1343
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,120
Why did you leave him behind?

1344
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,880
We left all the uncool ones behind.

1345
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,200
He was once uncool?

1346
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,600
Crazy teeth, mad hair.
There was no place for him.

1347
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,240
So we left him.

1348
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:12,000
And on the day you left,
I vowed I'd never be called uncool again.

1349
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,280
And I've been cool ever since.

1350
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,680
Well, except the one time we landed on
Backwards World and I needed...

1351
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,360
It's a long story.

1352
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,360
Well, how do you feel now, brother?
You wanna return to our people, huh?

1353
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,480
You wanna come home?

1354
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,880
I am home.

1355
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,880
This is my home right here.

1356
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,880
Blow the Red Dwarf -
and everything on it - to hell and back.

1357
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,160
He couldn't have told me that
before I made my choice?!

1358
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,640
My Feral King, leaving an enemy
to be killed later by a deadly device

1359
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,040
often leads to an ingenious escape.

1360
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,160
However, if we kill them now...

Do you see where
I'm coming from with this?

1362
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,960
The clowder must witness their death.

1363
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,000
Only then will they realise
there is no Cloister.

1364
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,560
And no hope...

1365
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,920
...for ever finding a Promised Land.

about to go, Kryten.

Sir, I have been stand-in science officer
for many years.

1370
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:49,280
I would hardly endanger your lives
by not having enough charge

a couple of minutes left yourself.

01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,240
you don't have one last miracle
up your sleeve, Holy Poppadom?

1378

would be acceptable now.

You've probably got the idea by now.

Anubis? Who's he?

1388
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,560
A creature with the head of a cat
who embalmed the dead.

1389
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,440
Why would you embalm something?

1390
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,320
To preserve something.

1391
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,600
Something inside
that you thought was precious.

to save us!

I can't believe he's gone.

Yeah, but before that happens,
your goons will rip you apart.

BOTH: He did need a service.
