behind my ears and slip between the ropes.

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,473
- I mean it, Arn!
- Are fevered rantings one of your symptoms?

166
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,678
The universe needs a chap to look up to,
someone to right wrongs,

167
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,349
and just generally be brave,
handsome and all round magnificent.

168
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,837
- And you think I'm your man?
- It's your destiny, Arnie.

169
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,113
What? To wind up looking
like a reject from a Gay Pride disco?

170
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,914
You're just afraid, old son.
Afraid that you're not good enough.

171
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,198
- You've always wanted to play the hero.
- I'm not you.

172
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,954
I think we established
that in your last visit.

173
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,198
I'm not the Ace you
met last time, Arnie.

174
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,875
He caught the business end
of a neutron tank in Dimension 165.

175
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,238
- I'm a hard-light hologram just like you.
- Ace is dead?

176
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,195
I took over from him, and I
want you to take over from me.

177
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,270
My God! What is that stuff?

178
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,590
Light bee's been hit pretty bad.
It's a power leakage.

179
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,679
Electro-magnetic radiation.
I haven't got long.

180
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,272
About the time I usually like to spend
making love - say 12 hours, maybe less.

181
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,716
After that, I'll be too weak to train you.

182
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,559
What do you say?

183
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,549
It's part of the legend.
I'm not the first Ace, not even the second.

184
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
There have been... well let's
just say, more than a couple.

185
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,713
As one Ace dies, he recruits his
replacement from a parallel dimension.

186
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,998
We all start off as caterpillars
and turn into butterflies.

187
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,717
But you're talking about a man who at the first sign of
danger cowers under tables with a colander on his head.

188
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,922
Skipper, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

189
00:15:55,946 --> 00:16:00,077
And you can't confuse Rimmer with a
book. For a starter, a book's got a spine.

190
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,517
Let me train him, that's all I ask. Talk to him, persuade him.

191
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,157
(SNIGGERS)

192
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,552
- What is it? What's the joke?
- Nothing, nothing. (LAUGHS)

193
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,711
Well, clearly, it's not nothing.

194
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,953
Clearly, you've just heard something
terribly amusing, clearly.

195
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,479
It's just that Ace has just told me about
trying to get you to be the next Ace Rimmer.

196
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,991
Yes, sadly, I've gotta sort out my shoe
collection or I'd have jumped at it like a shot.

197
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,034
It's just you, y'know?
The next Ace. The very idea! (LAUGHS)

198
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,592
It's not so ridiculous, Lister!
Other versions of me have turned into him.

199
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,038
In fact, if I wasn't needed around here so badly,
I think I'd very likely take him up on it.

200
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,192
Rimmer, don't take this the wrong way,
but how could you be the next Ace?

201
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,597
I mean, you're a gutless,
spineless, gormless, directionless,

202
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,071
neurotic, underachieving,
snivelling, cowardly pile of smeg.

203
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,672
No offence...

204
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,629
But get real, man.
Most eunuchs have got more balls than you.

205
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,549
Well, that, my fine, madras-guzzling
friend, is where you are wrong,

206
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,714
because I've taken Ace up on
his offer, and training begins...

207
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,791
right now.

208
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,511
Er, why have you brought me here?

209
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,513
Take a look around, Arnie. The plateau, the summit.

210
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,672
This is where you must be
to become Ace Rimmer.

211
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,635
No, this where you must be
to become Maria Von Trapp.

212
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,116
Just concentrate. Feel the wind
on your face. Be the wind, Arnie.

213
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,750
Unleash the wild power
you know lurks inside of you.

214
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,390
Be the cougar running free and
unfettered through the mountains.

215
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,594
- Be the what?
- Come on, man. You can do it. Concentrate!

216
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,190
See the cougar, Arnie?
It's you. Can you see it?

217
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,237
Er... sort of.

218
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,518
Oh, I'll never be Ace.
We tried. We failed. I give up!

219
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,069
All your life you've given up.

220
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,754
Well, maybe after more training!

221
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,199
I can't keep up the dog and pony show
any longer. It's now or never.

222
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,279
- What's that?
- Light bee remote.

223
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,795
If you can fool your crewmates
into thinking you're me...

224
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,071
..we'll know you're ready.

225
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,274
- But I'm not ready!
- Try it the other way round.

226
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,196
(SUAVE VOICE) The name's
Rimmer... Ace Ri-oh, this is ridiculous!

227
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,316
Ah, Mr Ace, sir. Everything OK?

228
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,915
What? Er, yes, Kryten.. Krytie.

229
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,071
(SUAVE VOICE) Uh, yeah, everything's fine.

230
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,677
- Are you sure, sir? You sound a little different.
- Er... could you be more specific?

231
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,753
67% more weaselly.

232
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,718
Errrrrrr...

233
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,871
Ah, sore throat. Uh, sore throat.

234
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,351
Bug going around, a holographic virus.
But it affects humans too.

235
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,195
Arnie's got it. I've quarantined him
for 24 hours. No one's to go near him.

236
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,831
I was just wondering, sir,
we ran out of Bacofoil about six months ago.

237
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,233
I don't suppose you have a spare jacket
I might roast a chicken in?

238
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,550
Listen, you stupid,
jumped-up little son-of-a...

239
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,951
Ohhh! Sorry, old friend.
Afraid not. Catch you later.

240
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,910
I bid you good day, my Lord. I come
in search of the knave called Lister of Smeg.

241
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,554
Now, wait a minute, old friend.
Let's just stay calm, shall we?

242
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,549
- Are you one of his household?
- Er... in a manner of speaking.

243
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,910
Then prepare to die!

244
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,630
Ha! Yah!

245
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,074
Let's talk about this shall we. Over a pot of tea and some toasted muffins?

246
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,675
OK, how about some scones and clotted cream?
Dundee cake? Battenburg?

247
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,553
My God! I did it!

248
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,955
(KNIGHT'S VOICE) So far...

249
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,111
(NORMAL VOICE) ..so good.

250
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,314
I did it! That's the most heroic thing I've done since I
set fire to Stinky Bateman's turn-ups in 3rd Form prep!

251
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,878
Well done, Arnie.
You've done us proud. (GASPS)

252
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,512
Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for...

(SCREECH OF FEEDBACK)

254
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,039
What's happening, bro?
What's happened to Goalpost Head?

255
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,079
No, you don't understand.

256
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,231
It's not me, it's him.

257
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,392
Sir, you're in shock. The trauma
has made you speak like Mr Rimmer.

258
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,358
What happened to Goalpost Head?

259
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,959
Ah.

260
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,791
One of them knights
has escaped from the AR machine.

261
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,600
It's killed Rimmer. Isn't that right, Ace?

262
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,839
We should give Rimmer
a decent send-off, you know.

263
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,072
- It's the least he deserves.
- I just can't believe it.

264
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,596
Neither can I. I was only
insulting him just this morning.

265
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,391
Poor Mr Rimmer, I haven't felt this wretched
since Spare Head Three told me the others held a poll

266
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,120
and voted me the big-eared ugly one.

267
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,438
Hey.

268
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,719
- Decided what you're gonna do?
- I thought I might stick around here for a bit,

269
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,713
(AS ACE)
get the hang of the character, as it were.

270
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,352
- What's that?
- Ace asked me to fit it.

271
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,276
He said it would take his coffin to its final
resting place, alongside all the other Ace Rimmers.

272
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,115
He's left some more beacons behind
for the Aces that follow you.

273
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,271
I'm getting cold feet, Listy.

274
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,876
I'm not sure I can go through
with it. Leave, I mean, be Ace.

275
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,793
You heard what he said. It's your destiny.

276
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,157
It's my destiny to be a
smug, self-satisfied git?

277
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,151
OK, so he was a bit full of himself, but you
can be a different kind of Ace. It's up to you.

278
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,396
Look, he said if you got cold feet we should follow
the coffin. He said it might make you change your mind.

279
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,711
We are gathered here today
to say our final farewells to Mr Rimmer.

280
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,072
On occasion,
he was a small-minded, bureaucratic,

281
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,914
incompetent, cowardly little... person,

282
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,276
but he also had his good qualities.

283
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,676
Those WERE his good qualities!

284
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,319
To say something about the finer side
of his nature, I'd like to turn now to Mr Lister.

285
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,793
Alexander the Great's chief eunuch
has finally joined his master.

286
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,798
The man who kept his underpants
on coat-hangers

287
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,635
and sewed name labels
into his ship-issue condoms has passed on.

288
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,870
Life will never be the same.
We have lost the finest,

289
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,793
most dedicated vending machine
repairman the Space Corps -

290
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,954
no, no, the universe - has ever known.

291
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,513
No one ever pressed for a Coke and got oxtail
soup and orange juice by mistake on his shift.

292
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,560
Well, actually, that's not true we all did,
but what the smeg - this is his eulogy.

293
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,999
He didn't have very many friends, but those
that he did have were with him at the end.

294
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,597
Even Rachel,
who I suppose in many ways is his widow.

295
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,356
- See you, smeg-head.
- Later, bud.

296
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,070
Goodbye, Mr Smeeee-Heeee.

297
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,709
Bye...Ironballs.

298
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,356
And finally, this...

299
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,909
When Rimmer originally
died aboard Red Dwarf,

300
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,836
Holly brought him back as a hologram
to keep me sane - never an easy task.

301
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,439
He succeeded spectacularly, and for
this accomplishment, we award him this.

302
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,629
Kryten, place First Officer Rimmer's
decoration into the coffin.

303
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,791
Right away, sir.

304
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,394
Gentlemen... First Officer Rimmer.

305
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,916
First Officer Rimmer.

307
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,593
All those Rimmers...

308
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,756
They all did it. They all became
Ace and passed on their flame.

309
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,230
Are you really gonna be
the one to break the chain?

310
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,471
It's been a blast, fellas.

311
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,357
- Bye, man.
- Bye, dude.

312
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,200
Au revoir, Mr Ace, sir.

313
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,538
Stoke me a clipper,
I'll be back for Christmas... Whatever.

314
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,394
Just had to say one last goodbye!

315
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,993
- See you, Davey boy.
- Yeah, good luck, man.
