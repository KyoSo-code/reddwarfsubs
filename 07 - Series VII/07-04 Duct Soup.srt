00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,917
92 degrees. God!

2
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,195
I want a drink
but I can't be bothered to get up.

3
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,911
I wanna go to the loo but I can't be bothered
to go down the corridor.

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,118
This is one of the universal dilemmas,

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,717
so much as confronted all men
since the beginning of time.

6
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,396
To pee or not to pee, that is the question.

7
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,117
No, I'll just lie here
really thirsty with a full bladder

8
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,749
and try and get to sleep.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,911
Smeggin' hell!

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,318
One more time and you get this. Do you hear?

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,634
Don't think I don't mean it.
One more time. Just one more.

(PIPE CREAKS)

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,117
What did I tell you?
I told you! Didn't I tell you?

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,070
How many times have I told you?
Right. What was the last one?

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,071
"Nureek." So the next one will be a "rotut",

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,153
and the one after that will be a "hernunger".

17
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,756
Four seconds, three seconds, two seconds...

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,991
(ROTUT)

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,953
Now "hernunger".

(NUREEK)

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,551
No, that's wrong.
You've gone out of sequence.

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,872
"Nureek", "rotut", "hernunger".
What's wrong with you?

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,598
If you're gonna keep me up
all night, just do it right, OK?

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,036
(SQUELOOKLE)

25
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,876
"Squelookle"?
Where does "squelookle" come from? He's new!

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,238
Oh, that's better.

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,353
Hooooh!

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,551
OK...

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,597
Right, right.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,438
I can't hear you.
You can do whatever you like.

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,672
I can't hear a damn thing.

(NUREEK)

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,590
Oh, my goodness. It's Princess Leia.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,151
Mr Skywalker went that way, ma'am.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,958
- What?
- It's nearly 1 a.m., ma'am. What are you doing up?

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,151
Looking for someone
to kill. Care to volunteer?

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,192
Oh, can't sleep?

39
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,749
Have you ever listened to
those clapped out old pipes?

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,194
Nureeking and rotuting and just when you
expect them to nureek again, they squelookle!

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,478
It's enough to make a
perfectly sane person crazy!

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,350
It's quite amazing the number of people those
pipes have driven to the very brink of psychosis.

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,753
Mr Lister spent the night in there once and he ended up
trying to suffocate himself to death with an onion sandwich.

44
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,873
Look at this. This is a boys' fridge.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,913
Women would never have fridges like this.

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,750
Chilled trainers? It just wouldn't happen!

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,513
What would you say to a
glass of drinking chocolate?

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,395
I'd say, "Glass of drinking
chocolate, get me out of here!"

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,919
I can't live like this. I need a bath.

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,392
I hate showers, I've always hated showers. Ask anyone
who knows me what I hate and you know what they'd say?

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,474
- You hate showers?
- You see? Even you know and you hardly know me!

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,840
I need a bath. I need sleep. I need clothes.
I need cottage cheese with pineapple chunks in.

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,431
Well, the next Space Corps ship we come across,
ma'am, I'm sure we'll find some supplies

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,077
I mean, I knew when I joined the Corps
it would be tough in deep space.

55
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,358
I accepted shopping was unlikely.

56
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,399
But then I lost my crew, my ship

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,071
and I ended up here with a fridge
full of trainers, two sets of clothes

58
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,677
and pipes that squelookle
when they should nureek!

59
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,118
I mean, I've tried,
I really have tried to fit in!

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,432
I even tried learning what offside was.

61
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,631
- Oh...
- (SOBS)

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,078
Ma'am, please. I've never
had to comfort a crying woman before.

63
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,277
I'm not familiar with the technique.

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,511
Er, hang on. Just processing.

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,671
(BLEEPS) Oh.

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,279
Oh, I see! Oh, well, don't worry, ma'am.
I know the drill now.

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,152
- Huh!
- What are you doing?! Get off me!

68
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,631
The Heimlich manoeuvre, ma'am.
It believe it helps women stop crying.

69
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,275
The Heimlich manoeuvre
stops people choking, you idiot!

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,556
No, I think you're wrong, ma'am. Huh!

71
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,872
Of course I'm not wrong, you've just got a
corrupted file in your database!

72
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,550
- Well then, why have you stopped crying?
- Well, because it's really hard to cry...

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,109
...when someone's
doing the Heimlich manoeuvre on you.

74
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,477
- It really puts you off.
- But you're not crying, though.

75
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,240
Well, no.

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,149
- So it worked.
- No! It didn't work! It just...

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,834
Oh, shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,749
(EXASPERATED) Oh!

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,957
Where did it all go wrong?

80
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,678
My life started off so promisingly.

81
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,834
Rich parents, good school,
pony named Trumper.

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,670
How did I end up like this?

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,631
On a ship where the fourth most popular pastime is going
down to laundry room and watching my knickers spin dry.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,798
Oh, ma'am! That is not true!
No one has ever done that!

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,389
That's only because they
don't know when you wash them.

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,194
Couple of posters and a trailer before
"The World's Stupidest Stuntmen" video

87
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,590
and take it from me that laundry room will be packed!

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,077
I think you're doing Mr Lister and the Cat
a great disservice, ma'am. A great, great disservice

89
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,031
Wow! This is the best load yet.

90
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,390
Just for the record, I'd like to repeat
that I'm only here because I can't sleep.

91
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,110
- So I decided to do some of my laundry and help out Kryten.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,514
I'm not here because I'm a sad and lonely person who's
entertained by women's underwear spin-drying.

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,717
- My God! A G-string!
- Where?

94
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,279
You missed it.

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,637
I swear! It was black
and really really small.

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,997
I'm too mature for this. I'm just
gonna sit here read my comic.

97
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,430
Oh buddy, this is a great show tonight.

98
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,513
I may even write a fan letter to
the washing machine company.

99
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,514
Sometimes I'm really ashamed to be with you.
You're completely out of order, d'you know that?

100
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,430
- Since when did you get so mature?
- Mature? I've been mature for ages, me.

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,352
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,037
You're just pretending to be mature because that's
your plan to get Officer Bud-Babe to fall for you!

103
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,431
- Everybody knows that!
- Go and stick an egg up your nose.

104
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,273
- It's true.
- Isn't true.

105
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,164
- It is.
- It isn't.

106
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:42,176
- Is
- Isn't!

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,780
- Is
- Isn't

108
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:43,816
- Is!
- Isn't!

109
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,354
- Is, is, is, is! is--
- Isn't, isn't, isn't, isn't, isn't-

110
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,636
Sirs, Sirs, Sirs! What are you arguing about?

111
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,946
About me being really mature.

112
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,634
I've been looking all over for
you, sir. Why aren't you in bed?

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,832
The heating system's gone bonkers.
Why? What's up?

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,118
Oh, it appears life on board ship
is getting Miss Kochanski down, sir.

115
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,798
She's in the midships now, throwing knives into the wall and
shouting abuse at the fridge for not having any low-fat yoghurts.

116
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,749
- What's the problem?
- It's not helped by the fact that her sleeping quarters are next to the sewage processor

117
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,848
- You know how noisy those pipes are, sir.

118
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,800
We'll relag them first
thing in the morning.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,116
It's not just she can't sleep, sir. It's everything.

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,069
Not being able to have a bath,
no cottage cheese, no cl...

121
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,913
The thermostat!

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,993
I swear I set the correct programme! Oh!

123
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,949
Who on earth is going to tell her?
I mean, who...?

124
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,557
- Hi.
- (GRUNTS)

125
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,513
How are you settling in?

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,990
Great. Having a ball.

127
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,520
- We'll get you some more clothes.
- Don't worry.

128
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,355
I can wander around in a sheet
for the next 50 years. I'll be fine.

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,758
- We'll fix those pipes.
- If you could just make them go "nureek" every time

130
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,151
without any "squelookles",
I'd be so grateful.

131
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,316
- We'll stop them completely.
- I'm not used to this, not having stuff.

132
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,758
When I was 15, my brother Moose used to
kidnap my lipstick and hold it to ransom.

133
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,673
He knew that if I didn't
look good I wouldn't go out.

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,309
If I don't look good, I don't feel good.

135
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,357
How do you feel now?

136
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,831
- (WHIMPERS)
- Don't answer that.

137
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,550
I know I've been spoilt,

138
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,280
brought up in the trendiest part of Glasgow.

139
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,518
- Yeah, the Gorbals. You said.
- Eleven years in cyberschool,

140
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,354
perfect computer-generated setting,

141
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,797
with perfect CG teachers
and perfect CG friends.

142
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,031
Now I can't even have a bath.

143
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,840
Come on. Come with me.
I've got something to show you.

144
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,718
You take my quarters tonight,
and I'll have yours.

145
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,679
I've cleaned out an old retro
housing and filled it with water.

146
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,910
- I don't know what to say...
- And I, um... found this on that derelict.

147
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,714
I was saving it for your birthday.

148
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,554
There's some make-up in there, too.

149
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,876
I can't find her anywhere, sir.
I've been searching high and low.

150
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,714
Oh! Ma'am. I didn't spot you there.

151
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,759
- Kris is sleeping in my quarters tonight, Kryten.
- In your quarters, sir?

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,670
- Yeah, she's gonna have a nice hot bath.
- In here? Without clothes on?

153
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,713
Well, convention dictates probably, yeah.

154
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,757
Kryten, me and Kris have been having a talk,
and we think it'd be better all round if you leave.

155
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,032
- Uh, Sir?
- Well, as you probably know, we're planning on settling down together.

156
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,830
It started that night she had a bath
in my quarters, remember?

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,151
We got you this leaving present.

158
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,271
- A keyring.
- With a "C" on it.

159
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,796
- For Kryten.
- But you spell Kryten with a "K".

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,995
Oh, don't make a fuss. Now, I've packed
all your heads. They're in the bag.

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,993
You know what it's like, man. It's the fourth law
of the universe. You settle down with a woman,

162
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,437
and the first thing they do is systematically
set about getting rid of all your mates.

163
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,592
- The Cat's next.
- I've been packing his bag for over three weeks.

164
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,355
We want to be a proper couple
and have dinner parties,

165
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,751
and I think I've reached the age now
where I really should be wearing clogs.

166
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,078
We're all a bit embarrassed of you because you have a funny-shaped head.

167
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,517
- You're not human, are you. You're a robot.
- Yeah!

168
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,632
- Oh, hi! You're early. Come in!
- Great to see you!

169
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,276
Mwah! Mwah!

170
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,511
I've just seen the future!
I'm afraid, Mr Lister shrunk your uniform, ma'am.

171
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,274
- You only have one left now.
- Did he? Never mind.

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,630
- Aren't you mad?
- I'm too tired to be mad.

173
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,314
I just want to have my bath and get some sleep.

174
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,718
Right. I'll be going, then. Going.
After all these years, I'll be going.

175
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,958
- Are you all right, Kryts?
- Oh, never been better, thank you sir.

176
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,115
A keyring with a "C" on it! Unbelievable!
Thank you with a capital "R"!

177
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,995
- What's eating him?
- I dunno. I'll find out later.

178
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
Thanks for this. I really appreciate it.

179
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,476
- Hey, no bother.
- See you in the morning.

180
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,551
Right.

181
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,870
- Well, I'll be going, then...
- Yeah. Night.

182
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,509
Right, I'll.. I'll go.

183
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,079
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.

184
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,553
Tomorrow, right. If you need anyone to scrub your back
or anything, don't hesitate to call, I can be here in twenty seconds.

185
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,119
- I won't.
- Night, then.

186
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,556
- Night.
- Night. Night-night.

187
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,473
(BOOM)

188
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,796
What was that?

189
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,190
Hang on a minute. I've got a torch, somewhere.

190
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,514
- What the hell's happening?
- The generator's down, sir.

191
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,274
I was just adjusting the thermo-settings
and it overloaded.

192
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,956
Give it a few seconds and the
emergency back-up will kick in.

193
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,509
- (HUMMING)
- Ah, thank goodness.

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,511
I'll look into it immediately, sir!

195
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,677
(BUZZING)

196
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,870
There goes the back-up!
Now everything's dead.

197
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,914
- How come the doors closed?
- When the back-up goes down, the doors always lock.

198
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,196
Prevent fire, reinforce hull integrity.

199
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,119
So what's steering this crate?
Is autopilot down too?

200
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,039
Everything's down.
Oh, I wish I'd been more careful!

201
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,950
You mean this ship's carooming out of control through
space with absolutely zero expertise at the helm?

202
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,754
No change there, then.

203
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,429
We've got to refire the back-up generator.

204
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,548
The only way to get to the
backup is through the service ducts.

205
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,200
The what?

206
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,493
Two miles of ventways that wind
their through the ship like intestines.

207
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,634
There should be a
hatchway in your shower, sir.

208
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,150
- How long's that gonna take?
- Six hours, maybe more.

209
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,749
- Six hours?!
- Are you OK, sir?

210
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,237
Fine, yeah! Ahem... Yeah. Yeah. Yep...

211
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,669
The reading said last night that there was going
to be a meteor storm coming in directly ahead,

212
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,517
but it won't hit us
for at least 12 hours.

213
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,951
We should gather up some supplies, a little food, as much water as we can carry,

214
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,556
and maybe even that magnetic fishing game.

215
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,878
OK, let's go.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,439
It's so damn hot, I can barely breath. It's like
being stuck in a sauna with a fat man on your face.

217
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,318
I don't feel so good.
The walls are closing in!

218
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,160
- Are you OK, sir?
- I need to take a break, I need air!

219
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,550
He's claustrophobic. Didn't you guys know?

220
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,237
I'm all right when I know I can get out,
but now we're out in the middle, somewhere...

221
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,391
- I can't breathe!
- Have a drink, sir.

222
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,720
OK, take a look around. See if we can unscrew one of the
ceiling hatches, drop back down into the ship somewhere.

223
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,791
- Let's go.
- My throat's closing.

224
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,951
- I'm choking.
- Here, drink some of this.

225
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,437
You just need something to take your mind off it.

226
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,879
I wonder why Dave -
my Dave - wasn't claustrophobic.

227
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,071
Oh, thanks, Kris. That's really helping.

228
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,835
Now is not a good time to tell
me how great your boyfriend is, ok?

229
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,156
He wasn't my boyfriend. Not really.

230
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,795
- What?
- No, we were just good friends.

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,959
- No, but you said...
- I just didn't want to look like some sad loser when we first met,

232
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,191
so I asked him to play along.

233
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,791
- You weren't going out with him?
- He wasn't my type.

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,470
But he was well-dressed,
neat, sophisticated, sensitive...

235
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,678
You're so damn picky!
Why wasn't he your type?

236
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,315
- He was gay.
- You see? Picky.

237
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,233
Everyone has to be absolutely perfect
before you're int...

238
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,596
- What did you say?!
- He was gay.

239
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,393
- Gay?
- Yes.

240
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,870
Are you saying I'm gay in
an alternative dimension?

241
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,673
- Yes.
- Me?

242
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,159
That's why we only dated for a couple of weeks. It was
sort of his final attempt at trying to work things out.

243
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,749
Wait a minute. You don't think...

244
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,599
Now, hang on. I'm completely straight, OK?

245
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,879
I couldn't possibly be gay.
I can't grow a big moustache for starters.

246
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,953
- Ask anyone, it just grows in little clumps.
- Dave, shut up.

247
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,437
- I'm just saying.
- I really miss him. He was great.

248
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,176
(SCOFFS)

249
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,114
Sometimes we used to go to bed together,
and he'd just hold me.

250
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,910
- Made me feel everything was OK.
- Really?

251
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,910
Well, actually...

252
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,549
No, what am I thinking of? I am not gay!

253
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,310
- No need to make such a big deal about it!
- But I am not!

254
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,876
Back on Red Dwarf before the
accident, I had loads of gay friends.

255
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,673
- Y-yeah, so did I.
- Yeah?

256
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,036
- Yeah.
- Real friends that you were really close to?

257
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,197
- Yeah!
- Name one.

258
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,677
OK, what about... Bent Bob?

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,399
Bent Bob?!

260
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,269
Yeah, little guy,
bad toupee, used to work in catering.

261
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,474
That's what you used to call him, is it?
"Hey, Bent Bob! How's it going, mate?"

262
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,069
It was his nickname. It was affectionate.

263
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,359
And we obviously only ever used it behind his back.
Used to be one of the poker school. Nice bloke.

264
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,886
And he was one of your
really good friends, was he?

265
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,236
All right, I admit I haven't
had many gay friends.

266
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,273
Yes, you have.
You just haven't known they were.

267
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,552
- Like who?
- Well, I can only speak for my reality,

268
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,758
but on our ship, Todhunter.

269
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
- Todhunter?
- Yeah.

270
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,336
- He was married.
- So?

271
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,398
- He had kids.
- So?

272
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,069
- He used to fool around, slept with women.
- That doesn't mean anything.

273
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,157
Yes, it does!

274
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,839
Hang on a minute. This is garbage, isn't it?

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,038
You just made it all up to take
my mind off being stuck in here!

276
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,032
You're not really a sad loser
after all, are you?

277
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,919
God, I found that really attractive, as well.

278
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,551
Made me feel all kind of superior and macho.
Not that I don't usually feel macho, because I do!

279
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,513
Here, have another drink... heteroboy.

280
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,631
So, your Dave... isn't, is he?

281
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,995
Ah, smeg!

282
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,752
We've found a grille about 20 metres down on
the right which drops down into a supply room.

283
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,542
We can't get through to unscrew
the fastening bolts, but ma'am,

284
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,551
with smaller hands you
might have better luck.

285
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,718
- Will you be OK?
- Leave him to me.

286
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,871
I'll be OK.

287
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,198
Drink?

288
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
Boy, is it cramped! Whoo-ee!

289
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,278
I tell ya, if I was dead, you most
certainly could not swing me around in here!

290
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,596
- Cat...
- Talk about cooped up!

291
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,080
Cat!

292
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,352
Oh, sorry.
Not supposed to talk about that, right?

293
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,511
Right.

294
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,843
So, how do you get
to be claustrophobic?

295
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,631
Are you born that way or is it
because you're kind of sissy?

296
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,033
- Sissy.
- Yeah?

297
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,113
Yeah. Now can we just
change the subject, please?

298
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,795
So, how comes you didn't get it
when we was in that tunnel when all the walls...?

299
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,318
I don't always get it, ok, just sometimes!
When I know that I can't get out.

300
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,114
Maybe it's something to do with blood sugar.

301
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,113
But how come you get it at all, though?

302
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,832
I was 17, working in the MegaMart
part-time as a trolley-parker.

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,630
After a couple of months,
I fell in love with cashier number four.

304
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,510
She was 22, with
come-to-behind-the-bacon-counter eyes.

305
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,517
And there was just something about the way she held
her pricing gun that made me crash me trolleys.

306
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,277
We started seeing each other
in the stockroom at break time.

307
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,519
She gave you claustrophobia?
I didn't think you could get it like that.

308
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,035
No. She was married to this bald bloke who used
to serve the fish, ten years older than her.

309
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,875
He was more interested in this amateur
dramatics group he used to run than her.

310
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,351
One evening, we were both on the
late shift and we snuck into the stockroom

311
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,433
and started making love
on a box of tinned asparagus.

312
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,592
After a couple of minutes -
about halfway through, I was 17 -

313
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,115
she leap up and said, "There's someone at the door!"

314
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,272
So, I jumped into this wooden packing crate. It was him!

315
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,789
He asked what the hell she was doing lying
on a box of reduced tinned dented veg with no kit on.

316
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,318
She said she was trying to get an all-over tan
from the light bulb. He was having none of that.

317
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,792
He sealed me up in the box and said he was gonna
drop me in the canal. He drove me out there!

318
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,713
I was screaming at him,
pleading, "Let me out!"

319
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,238
I promised him anything,
said I'd never see her again, just let me out!

320
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,598
In the end, he relented,
and I heard the box being opened.

321
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,037
I stepped out... bollock naked...

322
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,398
right in the middle of the Bootle Players amateur production
of "The Importance of Being Earnest".

323
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,835
Boy, that's enough to freak anyone out!

324
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,830
I had no idea Mr Lister was claustrophobic. Why did he never mention it?

325
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,793
Well, it's probably not something
he feels comfortable talking about.

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,152
- He's told me about everything else about his life.
- Not everything, Kryten.

327
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,352
- Absolutely, ma'am!
- Everything?

328
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,074
Before you arrived, nights were long and dull.

329
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,675
Cheese Slice Snap can only entertain for so long.

330
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,190
So what did he tell you about me?

331
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,869
Oh, absolutely everything, ma'am.
I don't think he missed a single detail.

332
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,952
You mean he told you... about the rusty gate?

333
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,959
Oh, the rusty gate, that was
one of the first things he told us.

334
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,192
- We all had a good laugh about that!
- He told you that?

335
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,911
He told you that I make a sound like a rusty
gate when I'm making love? He told you that?!

336
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,149
No, he told us his grandma
once had a rusty gate, and he helped fix it.

337
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,351
And that gave you a good laugh?

338
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,712
Well, like I say ma'am, nights were long and dull.

339
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,996
We were glad of the anecdote.

340
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,669
So he didn't...? Just shut up, OK. I never said that.

341
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,034
Allow me a second, ma'am. Just cross-filing that
story under "B" for blackmail and "A" anecdote

342
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,830
and sub-category "S" for
"so funny you'll laugh till you're sick".

343
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,430
Look, wig-stand-head,
me and Dave, it's all in the past.

344
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,441
In which case, ma'am, why
does he keep looking at you

345
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:12,032
in the same way a starving man would
look at a packet of roasted peanuts?

346
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,870
- Well, it's because...
- It's because, ma'am, he can't get wait to get the wrapper off

347
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,350
and taste the salty goodness!

348
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,196
- That's his problem, I'm accounted for.
- What about the way you look at him?

349
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,198
- What way?
- I've seen the way!

350
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,075
- What way?
- Like he's a pot of cottage cheese with pineapple chunks in!

351
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,476
How can you say that?!

352
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,599
I have never looked at him like he's a pot
of cottage cheese with pineapple chunks in!

353
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,239
Maybe, once or twice, plain cottage cheese,
but never, ever with pineapple chunks in!

354
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,630
Never. Never!

355
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,960
Have I?

356
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,749
- What's that?
- What's what?

357
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,150
Can't you hear it yet?

358
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,755
Like a... roaring noise.

359
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,911
A roaring noise?

360
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,232
Like a... watery kind of roaring noise.

361
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,391
I can't hear a thing.

362
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,634
It's like water roaring down,
say... a passageway...

363
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,792
in a kind of roaring, watery kind of way.

364
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,110
I wonder what the hell it is.

365
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,319
- Hey, where are you going?
- Kris! Kryten! Recyc water!

366
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,630
Every four hours, the
ductways get backwashed!

367
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,071
You know what, I think I just solved
the watery roaring noise problem.

368
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,231
- Come on!
- I ain't going with you!

369
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,153
- Why not?
- That's where the water's coming from.

370
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,551
You can be really dumb sometimes,
you know that?

371
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,071
(WATER ROARING)

372
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,509
I hate this! I really hate this!

373
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,794
- What's that?
- What's what?

374
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,112
- That noise.
- Oh, not again! What noise?

375
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,317
Is it a roaring, watery kind of noise?

376
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,189
No, not that noise.
This is a different kind of noise.

377
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,151
Is it a sort of "Cat being smacked on the head by
a smegged-off Lister's fist" kind of noise?

378
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,756
It's a sort of... swirly... windy...

379
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,639
water-drying, hurricaney kinda noise!

380
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,953
A swirly, windy,
water-drying, hurricaney kind of noise?

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,880
The dryer!
The vents get dried after the backwash!

382
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,515
- (WHOOSHING)
- Here it comes.

383
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,317
Whooooaaa!

384
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,793
I am not having a good day!

385
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,030
This should help, sir, take away the rising panic.

386
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,198
- What is it?
- There was a first-aid box in the supply store.

387
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,000
Lemoplathinominecathorylite.

388
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,913
Well done, ma'am.

389
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,559
Well, everything considered,
we've made good time.

390
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,112
What if we're down here for days and end up having to
eat each other like those dudes from that plane crash?

391
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,359
Those were exceptional circumstances, sir.
Their only other choice was airline food.

392
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,514
- It won't happen to us.
- Good, 'cos there's no way I could ever eat a person.

393
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,951
No way I could ever cook one, either,
not without my slow cooker.

394
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,516
- What about drinking your own urine?
- Well, that's absolutely out of the question.

395
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,956
You should never serve urine with white meat.

396
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,752
I hate the dark. It reminds me
of being back in the orphanage school.

397
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,833
The dorm was always pitch black.

398
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,676
The tight sods didn't allow so much
as a night-light, just to save electricity.

399
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,789
I remember one night, the lights went out and,
as usual, Squeaky Gibson's bed started up.

400
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,270
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!

401
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,435
We all picked up our shoes and threw them at
him. "Shut up, Gibson! We're trying to sleep!"

402
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,595
Anyway, we all settled back down,
and after a while his bed springs started up again.

403
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,438
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!
More shoes, football boots, trainers, everything.

404
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,989
There was no stopping him,
he just got faster and faster.

405
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,552
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!
Squeak! Squeak! So I got up, snapped on the light,

406
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,954
and there under a mountain of shoes
was poor old Squeaky having an epileptic fit.

407
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,796
I managed to wedge one of my trainers
into his mouth. Probably saved his life.

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,675
Cyberschool was so different.
We'd arrive on the first day of term,

409
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
put on our total immersion suits
and get connected to the mainframe.

410
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,320
And suddenly, there we'd be in a perfect replica
of a girls' boarding school.

411
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,110
We had Miss Brody for English,
Mr Chips for maths.

412
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,716
For history, they brought in Disraeli
and Genghis Khan.

413
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,236
For literature, they let us talk
to Shakespeare and Dickens.

414
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,597
I can't wait to hear what they
did in sex education class.

415
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,837
At 18, when I finally got
out, I kind of went off the rails.

416
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,114
- How off the rails?
- There are the rails. There's me.

417
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,834
That's way off the rails.

418
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,753
- So? What did you do?
- Well, you name it.

419
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,873
- No, you name it. What did you do?
- Well...

420
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,556
- Yeah?
- What, you want me to write you a list?

421
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,279
Yeah.

422
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,071
OK, I, er...
Well, I I- smoked cigarettes sometimes.

423
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,436
I wore skirts that were quite short.

424
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,798
- I went to the library and was really noisy.
- Really (?)

425
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,430
No, not really.
I was in real life for the first time.

426
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,592
No protectors. I went insane.

427
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,713
- Really?
- Yeah. I was a retro-punk.

428
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,598
(ALL) Wow!

429
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,354
They always say the hardest
part about leaving cyberspace

430
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,638
is realising the whole universe
does not revolve around you.

431
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,474
Sure doesn't. It revolves around me.

432
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,753
- Absolutely.
- No, I'm serious. Look at the evidence.

433
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,394
What evidence?

434
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,991
Take food. Until I bite into it, it has no taste.

435
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,073
Even when I know what I'm
gonna say, never bores me.

436
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,999
- You and you alone.
- And here's the clincher.

437
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,040
All of the interesting things that ever
happened to me happened when I was in the room.

438
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,714
Coincidence? Get outta here!

439
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,596
According to my reckoning,
we should be halfway across B-deck by now.

440
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,197
Boy, is this place hot!
Satan could come here on his winter break!

441
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,753
Hang on. How come it's getting hotter
when the generators have packed in?

442
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,697
It should be getting
colder, shouldn't it?

443
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:53,593
Ma'am, that meteor storm you said we were
heading towards, what direction was it in?

444
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,360
- Dead ahead.
- Anything else in the vicinity?

445
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,554
- To the west, there is a sun, but that's it.
- I think we've been knocked off course,

446
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,996
probably due to the initial impact
of the generators going down.

447
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,511
I think we're heading straight into that sun!
And it's all my fault!

448
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,836
- Kryten, man, it's not your fault.
- It is!

449
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,432
It isn't! You were just adjusting
the thermosettings and it overloaded.

450
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,476
I did it on purpose. I typed in
the override code on the access panel in the corridor.

451
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,000
(ALL) What?!

452
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,032
I don't know what to say, I didn't
realise it would be so dangerous!

453
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,359
- Kryten, man, what made you do it?
- I really can't remember...

454
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,791
- What do you mean, you can't remember?
- I'd really rather not say it out loud.

455
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,190
- It might sound a bit silly.
- Say it.

456
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,236
I didn't want you to have a bath, ma'am.

457
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,071
Well, it would be one of those "no-clothes"
baths, and Mr Lister would scrub your back,

458
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,837
and before we know what's going on, he's wearing
clogs and you're having Gelfs round to dinner.

459
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,920
And what would happen to me?
I'd have been on my own again!

460
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,910
- Oh, Kryten!
- (WHINES) I was just so scared!

461
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,670
- Come on, we've got no time to waste, let's get the hell out of here.
- But we're not going to make it, sir!

462
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,200
- We are!
- How?

463
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,710
We're gonna catch some surf!

464
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,438
- OK, here it comes.
- Tell me again, how do you hang ten?

465
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,319
Just get into position! Here it...

466
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,360
(EVERYONE SCREAMS)

467
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,157
(CRASH)

468
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,311
(SCREAMING)

469
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,153
Oh! Thank God we made it!

470
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,598
Oh, God!

471
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,432
(THUD)

472
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,430
How? How?

473
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,677
I, er... I, ah, er...

474
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,160
Oh.

475
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,634
Oh, that's it, we're fried, unless someone's got
some really terrific sunblock cream.

476
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,634
Not necessary, ma'am. I excluded the doors
from the shutdown override

477
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,754
- in case...(SQUEAKS) anything happened.
- (DOOR HUMS)

478
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,359
You mean we spent the night crawling from one end of this
ship to god knows where and back for absolutely no reason?

479
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,480
It was all pointless? You put me through that nightmare
when we could just walk out that door at any moment?

480
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,477
Well, if you'd excuse we've got some serious reversing to do.

481
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,555
but we'll talk about this over a cup
of coffee and a hot branding iron.

482
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,838
- well, night.
- Aren't you mad, too, ma'am?

483
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,793
You're not, are you? I think I understand.

484
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,759
For you, the trek through the
ducts was far from pointless.

485
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,312
It was an emotional journey where you gleaned
invaluable insights into your crewmates.

486
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,232
This was your rites of passage.

487
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,349
You feel enriched, wiser and somehow bonded by this
in a way that you never thought possible.

488
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,638
- Say "nureek".
- Nureek.

489
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,552
- Say "rotut".
- Rotut.

490
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,438
- Say "hernunger".
- Hernunger.

491
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,920
- "Nureek."
- Nureek.

492
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,400
- "Rotut."
- Rotut.

493
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,880
- "Hernunger."
- Hernunger.

494
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,360
- "Squelookle."
- Squelookle.

495
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,840
- "Rotut."
- Ooh! Rotut.

496
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,320
- "Nureek."
- Ooh! Nureek.

497
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,800
- "Hernunger."
- Hernunger.

498
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,759
"Squelookle. Nureek. Rotut..."

499
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,791
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

500
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,191
# I'm all alone, more or less

501
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,557
# Let me fly far away from here

502
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,314
# Fun, fun, fun

503
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,110
# In the sun, sun, sun

504
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,557
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

505
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,872
# Drinking fresh mango juice

506
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,317
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

507
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,074
# Fun, fun, fun

508
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,835
# In the sun, sun, sun

509
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,833
# Fun, fun, fun

510
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,039
# In the sun, sun, sun #
