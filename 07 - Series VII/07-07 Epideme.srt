1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,438
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,229
- What is that thing?
- Astroglacier.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,030
Allotropically modified, surrounded
by an envelope of luminous gasses.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,232
Thanks! That's most helpful.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,313
- What is it?
- To you, a big iceberg.

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,559
I studied them in my first year in the Corps,
but I've never seen one up this close before.

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,271
Isn't it incredible? Look at those
crystalline formations. They're faberoo!

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,998
You think all this sciencey stuff's
really interesting, don't you?

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,836
I bet at school you were always the one with the right
coloured pencils and the impossibly neat handwriting.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,632
I bet even now you can probably tell us the average rainfall
of the oil-rich coastal lowlands of Venezuela.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,996
No, I couldn't. I've no idea.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,991
OK, 3.4 inches. So what?

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,596
Unlike you guys, my greatest accomplishment

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,231
isn't a line on a loo wall somewhere
marking my highest-ever pee.

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,513
I'll have you know, ma'am,
I too possess qualifications.

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,752
What qualifications have you got,
meat-tenderiser-head?

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,309
I'm a fully qualified Bachelor of Sanitation.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,599
You may not know this, sir, but many years ago
I completed my course at Toilet University,

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,149
where I studied the lavatorial sciences.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,796
Toilet University's just a piece of
software, it's part of your core program.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,358
I still had to complete a written examination to indicate
the program was successfully installed.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,515
It was most interesting. Did you know for instance that
the first siphon and valve flushing system

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,991
was patented in 1778 by Joseph Bramah,

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,629
whose U-bend curvature equations are still...

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,313
- Kryten.
- Yes, sir?

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,150
Can this story maybe wait?
Ideally, until after I'm dead.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,870
Well, speaking personally, I hardly didn't get
no formal education at all.

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,759
- No kidding, Professor.
- No, it's true, bud.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,198
That's why sometimes I don't know stuff,
like... well, practically everything.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,429
- Was this because you brought yourself up, sir?
- Right. There was no one else around so I had to teach myself.

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,151
And seeing as I didn't know anything to begin with,
lessons were long and slow,

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,960
especially on Thursdays
when I had double nothing.

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,152
So what do we do about the ice?

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,510
Well, water supplies are low, ma'am.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,479
If the ice is uncontaminated,
it might prove move useful.

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,958
- OK, standard SEP scan and log.
- Locking on. Scanning and logging.

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,420
- Extraordinary.
- What is it?

38
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:56,010
There's something's buried deep
in the heart of the astroglacier.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,838
Some kind of object.
It's huge. Just processing.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,032
- Well?
- It's a starship.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,878
This place is harder to get into
than an airline Chicken Kiev!

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,353
It's the Leviathan, sir,
a 23rd-century JMC supply ship.

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,511
Engines are dead, power overload.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,674
Looks like they were running from something.
Wait! I'm picking up a life sign.

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,116
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Certain.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,040
I've never seen anything like this!

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,431
You weren't around
for my last party, were you?

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,117
Look at their twisted, tortured faces!
The sheer blind terror.

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,834
- (SCREAMS) Yaaaargh!!! Oh, my God!
- What is it?!

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,113
The back of my neck!
Great big gob of ice water!

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,069
It felt really horrible!
Went right down into my crevice.

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,111
Hey, guys, check this out!

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,071
There's a woman in there!

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,995
Just locating her JMC ident chip.

55
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,550
Caroline Carmen. According to the Psi-Scan,
she was once a supply officer on Red Dwarf.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,151
I remember her. She got reposted at Titan.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,391
- You knew her?
- Yeah, she made a pass at me once.

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,797
I don't believe you. A supply
officer would never go out with you?

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,797
She did, actually. In fact, me and Karen had
quite a thing going there for a really long time.

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,519
Caroline.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,639
Caroline, yeah. Karen was my pet name for her.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,270
- I don't believe a word.
- Caroline Carmen and me, believe it.

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,193
Sexually, we were just so compatible.

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,514
In fact, while I was dating her, the two women in the
quarters next door nicknamed her Carmen Moans.

65
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,991
- You could ask her if she was still alive.
- She is, sir.

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,674
The life sign appears to be
coming from this very spot.

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,716
Is it? Ah, well, she might not remember me
immediately. She might have amnesia.

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,319
- Amnesia?
- Yeah, ice does that. Gives you amnesia.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,869
- Isn't that right, Kryts?
- Well, I don't recall hearing that, sir.

70
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,071
See? It's affecting him already.

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,394
OK, let's get her back to the 'Bug.

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,352
I've begun the water siphoning process
from the Leviathan. Any change here?

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,793
It doesn't make sense, bud. The ice won't melt,
and this room's hotter than an English beer.

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,679
He's right. The temperature's
been a constant 90 degrees,

75
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,673
and yet she's still
completely cold and unresponsive.

76
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,030
What about Miss Carmen?

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,237
I was talking about Miss Carmen.

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,035
It's as if the body's generating
the ice as a form of protection.

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,191
Maybe we should just laser it?

80
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,558
Recommend we wait until the chemical analysis
results are completed in the morning, sir.

81
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,917
Any hasty lasering could result
in lasting damage to the body.

82
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,475
Do you really think she's still alive in there?

83
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,960
She must be.

84
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,999
Ah...

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,518
Well, well, well...

86
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,433
This is a bit of a turn-up, isn't it, hey?

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,796
You just couldn't stay away, could you, Kris?

88
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,951
Hey, what are you doing? Hey wait... what you doin?

89
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,391
(LAUGHS)

90
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,149
And what makes you so damn sure I'm interested?

91
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,995
You dumped me, remember? You think you can just jump
in me bed and I'm yours?

92
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,670
Well, as it happens, you're right, but let
me tell you it was a pretty close thing.

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,558
Mmm. It's good to feel your
sweet breath on my neck again.

94
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,236
Oh, smeg! It's Kryten! It's Kryten!

95
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,279
Quick! Quick! Quick! In the shower! In the shower!

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,319
(GROANS)

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,039
Smeg!

98
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,318
- Yeah?
- Are you alone, sir?

99
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,194
- Yeah!
- Well, I just thought I'd come in and dust your quarters.

100
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,194
- It's two o'clock in the morning, man!
- Ah yes, well this is an emergency dust you see, sir.

101
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,558
My sensors have picked up vast quantities of dust
in this region, I simple must dust! Right now!

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,156
- I'll take the risk, man!
- I simply can't allow that, sir.

103
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,353
Ah, double bed mode. Hmm...

104
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,273
I'll just, ahem, dust inside your wardrobe...

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,190
Under your spare bunk duvet...

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,676
Hmm... In your other wardrobe...

107
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,319
Kryten, man, I'm trying to get some kip!

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,711
- She's in here, isn't she?
- I don't know what you mean, man.

109
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,197
(SQUEALS) You promised me you wouldn't
like her more than me, you promised!

110
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,954
Look, Kryten, listen, I um...

111
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,590
- Look, it's like...
- It's because she's got a better shaped head than me, isn't it?

112
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,110
Not again, man. No! No!

113
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,357
- It is!
- I like your head!

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,852
Not as much as you like hers!

115
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:55,236
What are you talking about? You've
got one of the all time great heads.

116
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,271
It's attractive, it's functional, it's almost
perfect for carving a Sunday roast!

117
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,278
She's in the shower, isn't she? Isn't she?!

118
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,831
- Who?
- Miss Kochanski! Who do you think? Madam Curie?!

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,470
What is all this noise about? I can't sleep!

120
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,553
Forgive me, sir.

121
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,438
Shame mode.

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,591
Excuse me, ma'am.

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,514
How the hell did you do that?

124
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,435
Of course! You slipped out through the vent
shaft and dropped into the corridor. Brilliant!

125
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,069
- What?
- You're a genius, an absolute genius!

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,231
- What are you doing?
- I'm unbuttoning your shirt.

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,516
- What are you doing that for?
- We've got a little unfinished business!

128
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,559
That was a long time ago.
Things are very different now!

129
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,996
Look, he's gone. Don't worry about Kryten.

130
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,993
Now come on, get your kit off
and I'll go slip into my Batman outfit.

131
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,959
You really believe in being direct, don't you?

132
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,431
Come on, rumpy-pumpy, Kris.
Let's hit the springs!

133
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,839
That's your idea of seduction, is it?
Well forget it, Lister, not if you were the last man alive.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,709
- I am the last man alive.
- I rest my case.

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,198
What did I do wrong? What?

136
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,117
Oh, duvet...

137
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,237
Oh, my God! Caroline!
You've really let yourself go.

138
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,792
You're like the before bit
for about 900 Clearasil commercials!

139
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,999
Sorry!

140
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,024
(ALARM SOUNDS)

141
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,359
God! Ah!

142
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,750
God! God!

143
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,354
Oh! Are you all right, sir?

144
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,990
I've just been molested
by Tutankhamun's horny grandma!

145
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,790
Of course I'm not smeggin' all right!
Eurgh! The taste!

146
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,078
I need to go and gargle with a Toilet Duck!

147
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,838
She's dead, sir. And, curious, it appears
she's been dead for three million years.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,710
If she's been dead for three million years,
where did the life signs come from?

149
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,113
Good point, sir.
And more to the point, where did they go?

150
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,273
(THUD)

151
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,313
- I feel really lousy.
- Oh you're probably just in shock. Don't be such a baby.

152
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,718
Miss Kochanski, ma'am, If I may say so your
bedside manner leaves something to be desired.

153
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,072
- Like what?
- Well, like a bedside manner!

154
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,317
You think I'm a hypochondriac?

155
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,640
You're a man, aren't you? I mean, you all get
the common cold and you think it's malaria.

156
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,189
And women, of course, are different?

157
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,279
They just have a different
perspective on pain, Kryten.

158
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,152
As would you if every summer you had to pour hot wax
on your crotch and rip out half your thatch.

159
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,920
He's right. I hate doing that.

160
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,589
- The tests are complete.
- (LISTER) And?

161
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,755
There's a foreign substance in your blood,
and, well, I recognise the DNA, sir.

162
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,191
- Is that good or bad?
- It's the Epideme virus, sir.

163
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,557
A man-made parasite created
as a rival to the nicotine patch.

164
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,960
Epideme was an intelligent organism, designed
to block all neural signals relating to nicotine craving,

165
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,910
but it in practice it also blocked the signals
telling the body it needed blood and oxygen.

166
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,954
Is that why the Carmen chick looked like the
centrefold from this month's "Playzombie"?

167
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,519
Precisely. It's virtually unstoppable. For
the first 48 hours, it consumes its host,

168
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,872
then hijacks the corpse
and goes looking for a new victim.

169
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,556
When it can't find one,
it freezes the body and waits.

170
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,714
- So the life signs on the Leviathan...
- Didn't belong to Carmen,

171
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,474
but to the parasite inhabiting her body...

172
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,871
which passed to you the moment she, well...

173
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,469
Slipped her mouth-meat down me gullet?

174
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,035
I've been tongue-hockeyed to death!

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,478
In 48 hours, I'm gonna be deader than a
Saturday night in Salt Lake City!

176
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,477
There is one option, sir. I believe you might
have a chance if you, well... reason with it.

177
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,071
- Reason with what?
- The virus, sir. After all, it is intelligent.

178
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,478
Kryten, are your neural circuits picking up
interference from the tumble-dryer again?

179
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,550
If we could patch in the universal translator,
it might just be possible to talk to it.

180
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,438
I believe it's your only chance, sir.

181
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,714
It's a long shot, I know, but if we can reason
with it, we might persuade it to leave.

182
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,716
- Now, remember, be charming.
- Be charming to my virus. Right.

183
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,275
- Patching in the UT.
- Aaand a great big "hi" to all of you out there in flesh and blood land!

184
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,829
And tonight, Dave Lister, assisting
vending machine sub-operative

185
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,992
and spice food connoisseur,
this is your death!

186
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,158
- Your line.
- I take it we're speaking with the Epideme virus?

187
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,070
Give that man an eyebrow!
Hey, I'm feeling generous. Give him two!

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,231
Well, maybe we should, um... can I, er...?

189
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,195
Dave, let's run down the rules.
If you win, you get to live.

190
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,389
If I win, you get to die and I take
all your knowledge when I kill you.

191
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,234
What, you absorb knowledge
from every person you kill?

192
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,353
So as you can appreciate killing you
ain't exactly a career highlight.

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,390
No offence but when you're a virus, there's not much call
for knowing how to open a lager bottle with your anus.

194
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,680
How can you justify
killing another living being?

195
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,552
How about that chicken you biryanied
last night? How can you justify killing that?

196
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,996
Me and the chicken, it was different.

197
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,800
How's that, David?

198
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,429
Well, I'm a person. It was a curry.

199
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,720
He died so you could go on living.
Is that so different from what I'm doing?

200
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,077
Of course it is! Totally! I'm a human being.

201
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,551
I have certain qualities
that elevate me above poultry!

202
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,591
- I can think. I can play the guitar.
- Better than a chicken? Are you crazy?

203
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,957
We're losing the argument, sir!
You better move on to another subject.

204
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,515
I'm the last guy alive!

205
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,635
- And that gives you more right to exist than me?
- Well, yeah, because...

206
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,390
Time for your species to check out, Davey.
Arrivederci, humies!

207
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,398
Oh!

208
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,959
David, come on.

209
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,720
You've got a virus. It's fatal. It happens.

210
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,871
Doesn't mean we can't be friends.

211
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,031
Don't touch that dial!

212
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,550
Sir, you know how you told us all to work
on a solution to Mr Epideme, no matter how drastic?

213
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,957
- Yeah, what have you got, Kryts?
- A solution, sir, but, er...

214
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,440
- What?
- It's too drastic.

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,876
- Tell.
- Well, what we thought was...

216
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,350
- You see...
- We want to cut off your arm.

217
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,915
- You what?!
- It's a stupid idea, I told you it was a stupid idea!

218
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,179
It was your idea!

219
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,152
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- I'm not calling you stupid, shut up!

220
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,159
It's our only chance to save you.
It could be worse.

221
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,035
- What, you mean I could be planning a career in archery?
- You could be dead.

222
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,794
Now, you said you'd consider anything. Well, this is it.

223
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,155
Can I have some details? Something a little bit more
inspiring than "Can I hack off your limb?"

224
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,318
The plan is to inject anti-virals in a
precise pattern through your body,

225
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,511
forcing Epideme into your arm.

226
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,240
And then you cut it off. Great plan (!)

227
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,151
What choice have I got?

228
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,550
OK, but make it my left arm, OK? 'Cause
my right arm does all my favourite things.

229
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,673
- OK, sir.
- Let's go! Chop-chop!

230
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,353
Sorry.

231
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,919
(WHIZZING)

232
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,711
Injecting anti-virals.

233
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,515
OK, virus heading north.
Grid coordinate 109.4.

234
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,078
- The pancreas.
- 104.2, on my mark. Mark.

235
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,870
And heading for the left shoulder, 309.0.
No, no, no, no!

236
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,158
308! 308!
It's heading away from his left arm.

237
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,072
406.9... .8... 406.5...
Virus heading into his right arm.

238
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,910
The right arm! It's our only chance.
Laser bone-saw, sir, quickly!

239
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,071
Amputation mode - cut and cauterise!

240
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,151
(HISSES)

241
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,471
It's not enough.

242
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,191
Still not enough.

243
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,711
Still not enough.

244
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,551
Still not enough!

245
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,115
OK, that's enough.
If this doesn't work, we're out of options.

246
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,599
Whether it works or not, it's gonna be a cold
day in hell before I touch barbecue wings again!

247
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,879
Aaah!

248
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,232
He's awake!

249
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,119
My left arm... My left arm, I said!

250
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,319
That's my right. What kind of navigation
officer can't tell left from right?!

251
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
We did the best we could. I am so sorry.

252
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,837
- Where is it?
- We flushed it into space. We had to.

253
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,351
Oh, my right arm.
I did everything with that arm.

254
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,070
We were inseparable!
At least, I thought we were.

255
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,033
- Mr Lister, sir, you're awake!
- Buddy, you look great!

256
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,997
Oh it's... It's not your fault. You did
what you had to do to save my life.

257
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,316
(WHINES)

258
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,670
You haven't saved my life?

259
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,919
Seven per cent of Epideme's virions
have found their way back into your body.

260
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,151
They're currently multiplying exponentially.

261
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,117
So, to sum up - all's I've got to look
forward to now is death, zombification

262
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,079
and a quick after-death snog
with either you or the Cat?

263
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,790
I've given my arm - my arm - for nothing?

264
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,270
Not nothing, sir! Based on my calculations,

265
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,671
it's bought you approximately
58 minutes more life. I-

266
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,960
- What am I gonna do with 58 minutes more life?
- Have half a juggling lesson?

267
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,111
You're really not helping.

268
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,074
Kryten, he doesn't like them like that.

269
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,557
Begging your pardon, ma'am, I've been
with Mr Lister for many years now.

270
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,913
And I don't need some judy-come-lately
advising me on his sleeping arrangements.

271
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,479
Kryten, in my dimension, I cohabited with him.
I think I know what makes him happy in bed.

272
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,476
So do I. A large packet
of extra-spicy tortilla chips

273
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,158
and a really good horror movie, preferably featuring
some scantily clad, kung-fu-fighting lady vampires.

274
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,591
Hey! Old five-fingers has checked out!

275
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,112
- Oh, my God! You mean...
- No, not dead. Checked out. He's gone.

276
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,513
And about 40 pounds of Incinerex blasting
plastic has gone missing from Supply Bunker 7.

277
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,672
- You think there could be a connection?
- Come on!

278
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,756
- What are you doing?
- I'm just popping down the corner shop.

279
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,309
- Does anyone want anything?
- Sir, please, come back.

280
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,994
There's no reason to return to the Leviathan.

281
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,398
It's the only way, Kryten.
Get back over there, detonate this stuff

282
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,756
and destroy all traces of the virus.

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,470
- At least I'll rob it of the satisfaction of killing me.
- Dave, close the airlock.

284
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,598
- What you're doing is insane.
- She's right.

285
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,998
You've already screwed up the ping-pong tournament.
You gonna mess up the yo-yo championships, too!

286
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,075
Dave, don't go through that door! If you go through that
door, I'll never speak to you again as long as you...

287
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,159
Oh, my God! Just how stupid am I?

288
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,631
- Well, according to my calculations, ma'am...
- Kryten, shut up!

289
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,400
Hey, Dave, what's this?
The Christmas special?

290
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,358
That's right, man, yeah!
Look what I got you - 40 pounds of Incinerex.

291
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,552
It's macho, but it's not you.
You get what I'm sayin'?

292
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,913
Let's set the timer for
five minutes, shall we?

293
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,873
Er, Dave, hellooo?

294
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,640
(KRYTEN ON RADIO) Leviathan? This is Starbug. Come in, sir.

295
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,077
Kryten, get Starbug well away from here!
You've got five minutes.

296
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,275
Dave, listen to me.
Dave - my Dave - had a saying...

297
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,080
Even the word "hopeless" has "hope" in it.

298
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,511
Maybe you had to be there?

299
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,519
- What the hell did that mean?
- You can't give up!

300
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,393
I'm dead already. Use your eyes. I look worse
than the Grim Reaper's passport photo.

301
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,910
Please give us more time, sir. The
medicomp might still come up an antidote.

302
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,671
There's no point.
Look, I haven't made a will, but Kris...

303
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,272
under my bunk...I want you to have
the collection of songs I wrote about you.

304
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,716
- Collection?
- Well, three.

305
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,554
There's only two things
that rhyme with "Kochanski".

306
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,553
I used "underpantski" twice.

307
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,870
Kryten, to you I leave all my laundry.
Hey, keep it clean for me, man.

308
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,640
Oh, sir...you're too generous.

309
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,951
Cat, you can have
anything you want from my wardrobe.

310
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,915
I can? Great! I need some hangers!

311
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,711
60 seconds left, Epideme.

312
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,556
Dave, your heart says blow
but your brain says no.

313
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,511
You're no quitter. Hell, the people of this ship
kept searching for a solution right until the end!

314
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,796
- They never gave up.
- They didn't?

315
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,397
Hell, no! They even overloaded their engines.

316
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,554
So sad... because they were so near.

317
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,391
So near. They weren't running
FROM something but TO something.

318
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,279
Son of a gun!

319
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,593
Kryten, man, change of plan!

320
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,197
Sir, I've been meaning to ask,

321
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,512
as you retain specialist knowledge
from each of your victims,

322
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,278
and as the two of us have no gripe, I was wondering
if you'd be kind enough to fill in some gaps in my knowledge?

323
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,469
Sure. Shoot! I'm red hot in quantum
mechanics, sub-molecular biology and TV theme tunes.

324
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,756
Ask me anything.

325
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,156
Very well.

326
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,757
One thing I've always wanted to know,
who on earth was the fourth Marx Brother?

327
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,430
Zeppo. Easy! Ask me a hard one.

328
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,953
- A hard one?
- A HAAAAAAAARD one! Yeeeaah!

329
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,320
Very well. How could Starbug's drive module
be reconfigured to be made more efficient?

330
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,156
(INHALES) Re-route the pulse
relays via the auxiliary conductor nodes

331
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,837
and transpose all the prime numbers in the first
line of the output to the energy equation. (EXHALES)

332
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,113
- And that would make Starbug more efficient?
- 300% faster!

333
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,599
That's all we needed to know. The Leviathan
was heading for Delta 7 for the Epideme cure,

334
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,229
trouble was by the time we reached Delta 7, I'd be dead.

335
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,398
Unless we could work out a
way of making the ship go faster.

336
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,440
- And now we have.
- Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bacteria!

337
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,311
- How are we doing?
- Like a speeding bullet stuck in the back end of a bat out of hell!

338
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,272
Going into orbit right now.

339
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,751
Scanning surface...

340
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,956
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

341
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,310
The planet. It's been flamed.

342
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,271
There's nothing down there!
Not a building, not a plant... Nothing.

343
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,269
- You knew, didn't you?
- Heyy, I had to do something to make Dave think there was hope.

344
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,313
The whole planet was flamed to get rid of me,

345
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,359
but I'd already left in one of the Star Corps medical engineers,

346
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,990
who then made a house call to the Leviathan!

347
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,156
- How's it going?
- Life signs almost gone, sir.

348
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,234
And in tomorrow's episode,
Kris Kochanski has a nasty turn

349
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,040
when Dave,
her hilarious decomposing boyfriend,

350
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,319
returns from the grave to infect her
with a wacky but charismatic virus.

351
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,632
Until then, goodnight.

352
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,509
(HUMS "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN")

353
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,399
(CACKLES)

354
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,151
OK, last roll of the dice.
Dave, I'm gonna stop your heart, OK?

355
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,512
- (BOTH) What!?
- It's the last chance to save you. Do you agree?

356
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,599
You're gonna prevent Epideme from killing me by killing me?

357
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,950
I'll take that as a yes.

358
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,799
Is he...?

359
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,954
Dead? Yes, ma'am! Careful, Miss Kochanski,
don't get too close to him!

360
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,470
(EPIDEME CACKLES)

361
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,077
The Epideme virus has transferred to you!
It's infected your hand!

362
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,709
Aand the big showbiz news today is that, as expected,

363
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,556
the long-running virus Epideme
has been renewed for another season!

364
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,513
Wrong, bug-head! You're axed!

365
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,751
No! No! No!

367
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,798
Oh, my God! Did you see that?!

368
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,156
She...! She...!

369
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,039
Miss Kochanski, ma'am!
what...?! I mean, what...?!

370
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,237
Have you gone completely insane?!

371
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,391
- Kryten!
- Huh!

372
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,275
It was Caroline Carmen's.
I injected it with blood and adrenaline.

373
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,756
That really is quite extraordinary.

374
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,620
You know, I had you marked
down as a bit of a madam,

375
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:18,536
(KRYTEN CONTINUES) but I really have to accept
that I'm going to have to eat some of my own hat

376
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,200
I mean, you do annoy me in some ways, but really that was...

377

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,354
Ohh... Whoa... Where have I been?

383
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,919
For the last few minutes, sir,
you've been dead.

384
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,918
- Wow!
- How did it feel?

385
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,071
Ever been to Swindon?

386
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,670
- What's that for?
- For not staying dead!

387
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,753
Germs.
