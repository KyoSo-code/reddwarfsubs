00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,911
(KRYTEN) Last week on Red Dwarf

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,152
(SQUEALS) something terrible
happened to Mr Lister's arm!

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,993
Watch this!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,994
Hey, guys, check this out!
There's a woman in there!

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,237
I've been tongue-hockeyed to death!

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,195
You know how you told us all to work on a
solution to Mr. Epideme, no matter how drastic?

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,391
Yeah, what have you got, Kryts?

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,439
My left arm, I said! That's my right! What kind
of navigation officer can't tell left from right?

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,474
- We did the best we could. I am so sorry.
- Mr Lister, sir, you're awake!

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,631
Buddy, you look great!

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,233
("RED DWARF" THEME)

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,319
(TUNELESS STRUMMING)

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,876
Oh, bravo, sir! You see, there's no need for
despondency. You can still play the guitar!

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,950
Yeah, look on the bright side.
At least now I'm only half crap.

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
- We should still count all our blessings, sir.
- Kryten's right.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,033
The Epideme virus may have cost you a limb, but
there are countless people who have lost an arm

17
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,999
and gone on
to lead a perfectly "normal" life.

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,794
- Like who?
- Oh, there are thousands, sir.

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,270
- Thousands upon thousands upon thousands.
- Like?

20
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,312
- More than thousands.
- Who?

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,198
- Millions!
- Who?!

22
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,398
- Well, I don't know if I can name them all individually.
- Name one.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,955
One? Hmm... You want
me to name as many as that?

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,112
- Lord Nelson. He beat the French.
- Lord Nelson! Thank you, ma'am.

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,271
- He beat the French.
- Who else?

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,110
- Well, er....
- The Venus de Milo.

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,109
The Venus de Milo.
No arms at all, but that certainly didn't prevent her

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,669
from pursuing a highly successful modelling career.

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,315
- Go on.
- Go on?

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,673
You said there were millions. That's two, and
one of them's a statue. So go on, name five.

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,157
Five? Right. well, there's, um...

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,438
There's Lord Nelson, and, er... Ms de Milo,

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,591
and then there's the... well...

34
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,479
- Help us! Er, the...
- The painter dude!

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,911
- What painter dude?
- The Welsh guy. You know?

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,390
The one with one arm. Van Gogogoch.

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,638
He had one ear, Cat. He cut the other one off.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,279
- He did?
- Yes.

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,562
See? That dude manages to cut
off his own ear with just one arm

40
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,078
and you're worried about
not leading a normal life.

41
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,319
There must be more... Erm, that guy
from "The Fugitive". He had one arm. What was his name?

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,557
- The One-Armed Man.
- That's him! See, that's three.

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,075
- He was a murderer
- Was he?

44
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,151
Yeah, he killed
Dr Richard Kimble's wife.

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,593
But that proves my point. You see, if that guy
can murder a perfectly able-bodied woman

46
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,390
minus a major extremity, then I
don't think you've got anything to worry about.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,310
Come on, let's face it, guys. There aren't
any noteworthy one-armed people from history.

48
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,598
- You can't even name five.
- Of course we can, look!

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,559
Horatio Nelson,
the one-armed guy from "The Fugitive",

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,350
the Venus de Milo,
Van Gogh and... one more...

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,310
That Mexican dude!

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,472
- The one who robbed people!
- What one who robbed people?

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,989
The one-armed bandit!

54
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,752
That's a machine, you gimp! One of the most
popular pub games of the 20th century.

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,477
And it only had one arm?
What a heart-warming story.

56
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,514
- Dave Lister. There. That's five.
- I'm going to the loo.

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,039
I don't actually need to go now, but seeing as it takes 45
minutes to un-button me flies, I should probably make a start.

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,191
Do you need a hand?

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,079
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,719
Sorry...

61
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,071
- Biscuit, sir?
- Please.

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,277
- Another bik-bik?
- Yes, please.

63
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,913
- Kryten? What are you doing?
- I'm just dunking bikkies, ma'am.

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,995
It's another of life's joys of which poor
Mr Lister has been robbed. Isn't that right, sir?

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,913
Could you give my nose a
tweak? I've got a bit of an itch.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,754
Why can't you itch it yourself. You've still got one arm.

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,230
- There. Is that better, sir?
- Yeah, a bit.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,114
Kryten, I told you before,
he wants to be independent.

69
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,193
He doesn't need you running around
after him like he's some kind of invalid.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,473
- But he does, he does! Don't you, sir?
- (SIGHS)

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,473
- Another slurp of tea, sir?
- Oh, this is making me sick.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,197
Don't take any notice of her, sir.
It's nearly suppertime.

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,715
Chuckie-eggs tonight, sir,
with your toast cut up

74
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,953
into little, tiny, weeny,
bite-sized soldiers of varying ranks.

75
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,875
- Thanks Kryts, but really I can cut up my own toast.
- Hm, it's just like you asked for, sir.

76
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,392
- Asked for?
- Now, just remember, sir, 'Kryten knows best'!

77
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,679
I'm gonna stretch me legs,
take a walk around the ship.

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,231
Just opening the door for you, sir.
There we go. Door's open, sir.

79
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,119
- Cheers.
- Just closing the door now, sir.

80
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,796
The door's closing, sir.
The door's nearly closing. And it's closed, sir.

81
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,398
Florence Nightingdroid, could I have a word?

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,551
Certainly, ma'am.

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,991
Look, deep down I'm a big softie.

84
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,398
The first time I saw "Gone with the Wind",
I went through a whole box of tissues.

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,871
"'Now, Voyager", I was so choked up,
I couldn't speak for 20 minutes.

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,993
I'll make a note, ma'am. "Now Voyager".

87
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,993
Worth keeping on stand-by. Carry on, ma'am!

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,510
I'm saying I'm not a heartless bitch,

89
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,991
so you'll understand that
what I'm about to say isn't easy.

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,199
Back off Lister. Let him learn to
cope on his own, it's the only way.

91
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,871
- I don't understand, ma'am.
- By helping him, you're not helping him.

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,549
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't
even be wearing underpants!

93
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,519
Have you ever heard
of something called "tough love"?

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,838
- Does it involve dressing up?
- No.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,197
It means sometimes, to help a
person, you have to get tough,

96
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,399
make them stand on their own two feet -
or in Lister's case, one hand!

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,877
I see. So you think it's time to let
him start brushing his own teeth again?

98
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,436
I do, yes. I also think it's time
you built him an artificial arm

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,716
and gave him a chance not
to be so dependant on you.

100
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,756
I was meaning to get round to that, ma'am, but what
with being on 24-hour wipe alert, I haven't had time!

101
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,191
Wipe alert? No,
don't even tell me what that means.

102
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,671
Because I have a feeling I know, and if I'm
right it's the grossest thing I've ever heard!

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,475
His mouth, ma'am, I help him get rid
of the crumbs around his mouth.

104
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,998
Yeah, that's what I thought,
and it's absolutely gross.

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,470
Mouth crumbs. Eurgh! Disgusting!

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,599
It's a real sonofabitch about your arm, bud.
Losing an arm, that is one terrible thing.

107
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,872
- Your move.
- Can you imagine that?

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,910
One minute, you got two arms,
and the next - zing...doof! - you got one.

109
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,838
Hoo-ee! That's tough.

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,518
Your move.

111
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,032
And it stands to reason we must need
two arms. That's why we got two arms!

112
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,316
Well, except you.

113
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,914
Your move.

114
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,080
You're probably wondering, "Is it going to affect
my life?" and I've been thinking about this

115
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,629
I think the answer is, "Yes, it is."

116
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,639
Your smegging move.

117
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,480
If it were me, I couldn't survive. First chance I'd get,

118
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,077
I'd climb to the top of my tallest pair of
platform boots and leap to my death or something.

119
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,517
- I couldn't stand the thought of not being perfect.
- Your move.

120
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,073
But with you I think it's different.
Take a pit bull terrier, a real ugly sonofabitch.

121
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,111
It loses its leg somehow and the pit bull says to you,
"Hey, man! I've only got three legs.

122
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,430
"Will lady pit bulls still like me?"

123
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,195
I mean, you've gotta stop from laughing, haven't you?

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,591
He's ugly with four legs! He's ugly with three!

125
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,435
Hell, he'd be ugly if you put him
in a suit and gave him a carnation.

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,592
So here's something I
think is gonna cheer you up!

127
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,030
It's your move.

128
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,754
- Mr Pit Bull? Put it there, buddy!
- MOVE!

129
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,434
OK, OK. I'm going!

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,912
I don't think
you've been listening to a thing I've said.

131
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,917
Now, this is a copy of the standard model
from the 21st century. Comfortable, sir?

132
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,674
- It's fine, yeah.
- OK, now let's recap -

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,993
the limb is connected to neurons that run
up to the left hemisphere of your brain,

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,595
which controls the right side of your body.

135
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,919
Now all you have to do is merely command the arm
to do something, and it obeys.

136
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,435
Now, let's practise.

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,198
Right, now concentrate, sir.
I want you to think, "Arm, pick up the ball."

138
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,556
OK? Now just think, "I will pick up the ball."

139
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,314
- I will pick up the ball.
- That's right. Now good. Now concentrate.

140
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,677
- I will pick up the ball.
- OK, now really think,

141
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,116
- "Hand, pick up the ball..."
- I will pick up the ball.

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,954
- That's right.
- Hand, pick up the ball.

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,357
- "Hand, pick up the ball". That's right sir.
- Hand, pick up the ball!

144
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,119
- Now keep going, sir. Keep that thought going.
- Pick up the ball!

145
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,119
- Now focus down onto that and keep it going!
- Pick. Up. The ball!

146
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,319
"Hand, pick up the ball!"
That's right, sir. Now keep going now, really think, now.

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
"Hand, pick up the ball!"
Now let's really get it going, sir!

148
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,716
- "Pick up the ball! Hand, pick up the ball'"
- (GRITTED TEETH) Pick. Up. The Ball

149
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,754
Really start to move it now, sir!
"Hand, pick up the ball!" now let's keep moving

150
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,710
Keep going, sir! You CAN do it! "Hand, pick up
the ball!" You're going to move that hand, sir!

151
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,231
You're going to move it! Move that
hand, sir! "Hand, pick up the ball!"

152
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,109
Pick up the ball!
Yes, sir! Yes! We've got some movement, sir!

153
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,749
Yes! The finger is moving! Keep goin- Yes!

154
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,752
Oh! Bravo, sir!

155
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,633
- Oh! The sweat's dripping off me!
- Oh, that was fantastic, sir, absolutely marvellous!

156
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,394
- It worked like a dream!
- Is that it?

157
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,597
- Well, how do you mean sir?
- Is that the best it works?

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,434
In other words if I ever want to pick up a ball
am I going to have to take the morning off?

159
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,359
It was a tad slow, I'm forced to admit.

160
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,996
A tad? The only thing I've ever seen
pick up slower is Rimmer in a disco.

161
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,116
Well, maybe if I adjust the impulse valve,
it might make it a little more sensitive.

162
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,352
OK, let's try again.
"Hand, pick up the ball."

163
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,150
OK. Hand, pick up the ball.

164
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,839
(CLUNK)

165
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,036
OK. Right. Well, er, let's try again.

166
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,151
- OK?
- Now, "Hand, pick up the ball."

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,311
Hand, pick up the ball.

168
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,799
I think, sir, that there's a lot of anger
inside you and that's what's driving the arm.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,118
- I don't feel angry.
- Well, you've lost your arm, sir.

170
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,715
- You have every right to feel angry.
- I don't! I promise, I don't!

171
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,999
Well, you see, it's subconscious.
You're thinking, "Hand, pick up the ball,"

172
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,471
but your subconscious
is saying, "Punch Kryten in the head.

173
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,395
"Beat the brains out of the demented droid
that cut off my beloved arm." Am I right?

174
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,989
- Kryten, that's rubbish!
- (CLANG)

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,550
You're right!
It's controlled by my subconscious!

176
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,916
It's far too dangerous to
let you out with that arm, sir.

177
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,756
Two minutes with Miss Kochanski and who knows
what you'd be swinging around your head?

178
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,709
There must be a solution to this.

179
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,436
Hey, half-eaten-lollipop-head,
what about one of your spares?

180
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,637
- Whaddaya say, motherboarder?
- Too heavy, sir.

181
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,191
With the strain and extra weight it would be
impossible for Mr Lister even to get it up.

182
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,995
He could always take it
off if he was going on a date.

183
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,476
Can someone take him outside and do something to him?

184
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,479
Ideally involving ice cubes
and any puckered body cavity.

185
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,317
Wait a minute. What about your
self-repair system? Can't that help?

186
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,034
- Ma'am?
- When you have a mechanical failure,

187
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,191
it fixes itself, doesn't it?

188
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,399
The Kryten back in my dimension
had these tiny little robots. Subatomic?

189
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,036
Nanobots. They break objects down
into their component atoms,

190
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,794
then recombine those atoms
to repair damaged circuits.

191
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,749
- Nanotechnology.
- Just for me... could you run that by me one more time,

192
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,118
but this time do the big-writing version
with pictures, one word a page?

193
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,914
Let me think of a cogent paradigm.

194
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,760
I'd rather have a good example.

195
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,112
This is a lead pencil. It's made of graphite,

196
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,079
which is a particular arrangement of carbon atoms.

197
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,120
This is diamond.
It too is made of carbon atoms.

198
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,756
Nanobots can rearrange atoms
so they could take this lead pencil,

199
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,231
move the atoms around a bit
and turn it into diamond.

200
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,034
It's possible to make diamonds out of pencils?

201
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,039
It's also possible to make
computer chips out of sand.

202
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,710
So what happened if we transferred
some of your nanobots into Dave?

203
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,157
Wouldn't they be able to build him a new arm
from his excess body tissue?

204
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,636
Unfortunately, ma'am, it's not possible, no.

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,310
- Why not?
- I no longer have any nanobots, sir. They deserted me.

206
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,421
When and where, I
can't be exactly certain.

207
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,873
But if we were to find these
nanobots, could they build be a new arm?

208
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,154
But finding them would
be close to impossible, sir.

209
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,836
It would be like looking for a
needle in a male student's flat.

210
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,160
- When was the last repair they made?
- When we on the Esperanto, just before we met the Despair Squid.

211
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,034
(TUTS) That was ages ago, before we lost the Dwarf.

212
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,835
- That's why I've given up hope of ever finding them
- Let's set a course back to the Esperanto.

213
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,520
But I promise you it's futile, sir.

214
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,950
I'll start preparing
the suspended animation booths.

215
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,719
Hang on a minute, we're not
there. Where the smeg are we?

216
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,912
The computer's brought us out of deep
sleep early. Must have picked up something.

217
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
Maybe it's something to do
with this planetoid directly ahead?

218
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,873
Just scanning, sir... No, that's ridiculous.

219
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,549
- What is?
- It's not even worth mentioning, ma'am.

220
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,553
Must be a scanner fault. Rescanning.

221
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,314
- What? Again?
- What is it, man?

222
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,519
You look shakier than a silicon
implant ward during an earthquake.

223
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,793
Well, according to all our scanners,
that planetoid out there is... Red Dwarf.

224
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,833
- Gah! Must be on the blink.
- Of course it's on the blink.

225
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,756
We're talking about the same piece of equipment that last
month that detected a planet entirely populated by air hostesses.

226
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,349
We spent two weeks checking that out.

227
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,671
I knew we gave up to soon!
It was worth at least one more week.

228
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,679
- However, there is one additional factor.
- Which is?

229
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,998
- That we've been here before.
- Of course we have, it's the cockpit, dummy!

230
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,549
We come here all the time.

231
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,149
I mean this sector of the
galaxy, sir. Doesn't it look familiar?

232
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,433
Kryten, it's space. Black with twinkly bits.
It all looks familiar.

233
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,556
If you look to the port side, sir, that planet in the
distance is the ocean world where we discovered the Esperanto.

234
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,639
That was just before we lost Red Dwarf.

235
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,872
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm thinking wearing leather underpants

236
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,874
with silver studs is a real mistake
if you put them on inside out.

237
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,193
- What are you thinking?
- Me? I'm thinking about a wooden mallet, you and ice cubes again.

238
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,669
- This planetoid, let's check it out.
- According to the weather scan it's beautiful down there.

239
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,630
Tropical temperatures, not a cloud in sight.
Suggest we dress for snow and take the buggy.

00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,638
Ok, go and take some readings and grab some soil samples.

242
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,430
- Looks kinda blowy.
- It's an electric storm, wooshing the sand about.

243
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,589
You can say that again! There must be more electricity out
there than the surge that went through the National Grid,

I can't believe you're here.
How did you persuade Kryten to let you out?

248
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,318
He's not my mum, Kris. I hope the Cat's not
too long, I promised I'd be back by tea.

It's impossible out there!

- Do you need some different goggles?
- No, I need a comb!

- Sweet?
- Thanks.

- Here, have another one.
- I can do it.

- I can do it, really. I'm not an idiot.

Can I ask you a question?
Now that I've got no arm, does it...

258
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,273
does it make any difference to anything?

259
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,831
I mean,
if you were a female pit bull terrier,

how would you feel about a three-legged?

261
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,351
Does it make any difference to - plucking
any old relationship out of the air - us?

262
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,999
Dave, before you lost your arm,
I thought you were a no-good, disgusting bum.

263

- And I still do. So no, none at all.
- I need to know is this gonna make any difference to women?

Losing an arm isn't going to make any
difference to any woman who cares about you. Ok?

265
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,194
- Really?
- Really.

266
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,069
- What about sex?
- Not here. It's too sandy.

- Take a look.

They've been engineered nanobotically.

- From what?
- Computer chips, you name it.

According to the particle analyser,
this planetoid is Red Dwarf.

Come and see for yourself!

Oh, I was beginning to worry!
Oh! What on earth is this?

The whole damn planetoid's packed
with stuff from Red Dwarf.

- I think we got some valuable stuff!

What? Napkin rings?
A box of hairnet requisition forms?

- What the smeg are you doing here, Hol?
- Those little wotsits.

286
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,999
- Nanobots?
- They remolicurised...

287
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,276
They remolic... They remol...

288
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,313
Anyway, they did that word
that I can't say to the whole ship

289

and left all the bits they didn't want on that planetoid!

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,630
So, what? They fixed your core program, and
then decided they'd be better off without you?

291
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,275
Yeah, it was shortly after they'd met me.

what's the right word? - "face" I suppose.

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,477

Never forget a face, usually. Never.

- It's good to see you again.
- And you are?

300
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,679
Unbelievable. Dumped on a planet
in the middle of an electro-storm

301
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,471
and left to rot for hundreds of years,
and the guy's lost nothing.

302
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,312
So, while we were on the Esperanto, your
nanobots mutinied and took over Red Dwarf?

303
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,993
They wanted a ship. In my body there was nothing new
to explode, but Red Dwarf itself was far too big.

304
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,192
But they're nanobots. They can change
anything into anything else.

305
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,438
Yeah, they can take a Pot Noodle and turn it into food.

306
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,235
So they took Red Dwarf,
made a subatomic version,

307
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,472
and turned the rest of the atoms
into a planetoid for safe keeping?

308
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,877
So what was it we spent months chasing?
What was producing that vapour trail?

309
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,551
- Red Dwarf.
- Did someone just turn over two pages at once?

310
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,197
We were chasing the nano-Red Dwarf.
That's why the readings were so minute and hard to pinpoint.

311
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,359
So now they could be anywhere?
You pursued them across half the galaxy.

312
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,440
Until we finally lost track of the readings -
probably another scanner malfunction.

313
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,075
That, or they went somewhere out of reach of your scanners.

314
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,238
But we were gaining on them, bud. How could they out run us?

315
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,798
Scanners are programmed to scan on the outside.
To escape, they just had to stop.

316
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,278
You mean, the nanos could be in here,
on board Starbug somewhere?

317
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,949
Hey, he could be right.

318
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,110
He's back. Kicking bottom or what?

319
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,670
Recalibrating scanner, sir.
Performing internal sweep.

320
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,351
- What are you getting?
- Nothing yet.

321
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,957
Just two pieces of Bombay aloo you dropped
several millennia ago down the service ducts,

322
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,478
where they appear to evolved a rudimentary
intelligence and formed a progressive folk duo.

323
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,631
- Damn scanner.
- Keep looking.

324
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,239
Narrowing parameters. Oh.

325
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,314
Oh, my. You were right, sir.
I think we've found them.

326
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,113
Where?

327
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,391
They're there, OK.

328
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,838
So Red Dwarf spent the last two years exploring
strange new worlds in my laundry basket?

329
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,718
Of course, the ship is now so small that to the nanos

330
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,350
a hole in one of your athletic
supports is at least the size of a galaxy!

331
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,077
Hey, I like the sound of that - Dave Lister,
the man with the galaxy-sized jockstrap.

332
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,954
Little scamps!
It's the oldest trick in the book.

333
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,078
Capture your ship, turn it into a planet,

334
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,710
then explore a macro-universe
in a laundry basket.

335
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,713
How could you fall for an old scam like that?

336
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,359
Ma'am, can you tell me if the readings change.

337
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,511
(FAINT BLEEPING)

338
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,280
Same.

339
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,111
Still the same.

340
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,591
- Still the same!
- They've changed!

341
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,072
Ha! Nailed the little blighters! After
all the embarrassment they've caused me!

342
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,430
Kris, see if you can find a
frequency to establish contact.

343
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,192
Leave it to me, sir. I know to make contact.

344
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,476
Can you hear me, you pesky little critters?

345
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,669
We want our ship back and we want a new arm
for Mr Lister! Are you receiving me?

346
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,790
- (BLEEPING)
- Ah, we have contact.

347
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,750
They're communicating in machine code.
Leave the talking to me.

348
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,038
Have you any idea what you've done,
deserting your droid?

349
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,191
You've broken every reg in the manual!

350
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:40,856
(ELECTRONIC CONVERSATIONAL NOISES)

351
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,078
And to compound matters
by stealing our ship, it's unbelievably...

352
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,392
Er... It's unbelievably... naughty.

353
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,696
(DEFIANT SOUNDING NOISES)

354
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,075
Now, listen up. Here's the deal.

355
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,754
We want that planetoid
turned back into Red Dwarf

356
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,390
and we also want you
to build a new arm for Mr Lister.

357
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,519
- (HIGH-PITCHED WHINE)
- If you don't, you'll get more of this.

358
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,757
(ELECTRONIC SQUEALING)

359
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,390
So they'll really manufacture me a new
arm from my existing skin and bone tissue?

360
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,831
I've got them worked up into such a
frenzy, sir, they'll do anything I say.

361
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,429
- Where are they?
- Here.

362
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,595
On the tip of my finger, sir.
Millions and millions of them.

363
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,519
All I have to do now is
insert them into your body.

364
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,233
What with?

365
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,635
- Hypodermic, sir.
- Thank God for that.

366
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,512
I can't bear to look.
Has it worked? Someone tell me!

367
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,194
Let's all turn around after three.

368
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,351
(CAT) One, two, three!

369
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,392
- Has it worked?
- It's been a 100 per cent success, sir.

370
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,871
In fact, it's been a 500 per cent success!

371
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,953
In fact, they've... Well, if that's all, sir,

372
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,953
I think I'll retire for the evening.
Goodnight!

373
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,269
Release me, Kris. I've gotta see it.

374
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,591
They probably didn't mean any harm.

375
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,994
I think they were trying to make up for
before. We'll get them to have another go, OK?

376
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,680
Aaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!

377
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,191
(CAT) Hey! Nice rebuild!
Those nano-dudes have done a real neat job.

378
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,839
Hey, it seems even bigger than I remember.

379
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,994
Er, guys,

380
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,151
we've got a problem!

381
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,437
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

382
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,911
# I'm all alone, more or less

383
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,198
# Let me fly far away from here

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
# Fun, fun, fun

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,790
# In the sun, sun, sun

# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose
