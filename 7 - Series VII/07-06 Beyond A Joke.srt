("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,555
Mmm! Smells good, Kryten. What is it?

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,599
Something I caught
scuttling around the cargo bay, sir.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,149
Managed to land a monkey
wrench on it and the rest is history!

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,034
Scuttling thing a la monkey wrench?

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,430
Kryten, nothing I'm prepared
to eat has ever scuttled.

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,591
This mouth is a scuttle-free zone.

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,236
- It does smell good, though, what is it?
- Ah, the only clue I'm prepared to give, sir

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,869
is we're having it with green wine.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,515
- It's space weevil, isn't it?
- It is not, no, sir.

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,754
Look, the rule is simple. I will not eat
any animal that's ever been a cartoon.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,675
Weevils, rabbits,
dogs, cats, mice, roadrunners...

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,309
All out. I'm not a cartoonivore!

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,549
- Ta-da!
- Lobster?!

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,549
Poached in a delicate cream sauce, sir.
Little so-and-so escaped in the hold.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,357
- Where did you get a live lobster?
- The SS Centauri. They had four in their stasis block.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,952
You've really gone to a lot of
trouble over this, haven't ya?

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,140
You don't know what
day it is, do you, sir?

19
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,493
- Day? Someone's birthday?
- No.

20
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:35,397
- Christmas? Easter?
- No...

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,110
- National Have Something That Scuttles For Dinner Day?
- No.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,950
- Well what, then?
- Today's the day that you rescued me from the Nova 5.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,350
I thought we should have a surprise celebration!

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,182
I had no idea, why
didn't you say?...

25
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,191
Ah, if you'd said it wouldn't have
been much of a surprise, right?

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,236
Precisely, sir. It would have been about as unsurprising
as an episode of "Tales of the Unexpected".

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,356
- Eh?
- The old Channel 72 show. It was...

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,754
Everyone...

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,954
- Never mind.
- OK, everybody? Ready? Let's go!

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,879
- Go?
- We're going to the Artificial Reality suite!

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,192
We just loaded in that new software
we picked up from the SS Centauri.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,677
Can you believe the luck? Finding a
working copy of "Jane Austen World"?

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,117
It's the luckiest find I've made since I discovered
that tube of leg wax under the medi-scanner

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,271
You found my leg wax?

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,991
We're going to visit "Pride and Prejudice Land".
This is gonna be so great!

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,199
It's Chick City, bud! Five sisters, and
they're all hotter than a Mustang's exhaust!

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,553
- But what about the supper?
- The thing is, we didn't know.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,594
- Put it in the oven, we'll have it in a couple of hours.
- But I mean... It's just...

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,476
Look, I'm just trying to get the Bozo Brothers here
interested in something slightly more culturally sophisticated

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,953
than "Name That Smell" or the even more popular
"How Many Marbles Can You Fit Up Your Nostril?" game

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,590
- We'll have it when we get back.
- And you're going to go with them, sir?

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,229
- This is... It's unbelievable!
- I know!

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,792
Dave and Jane Austen are not
an obvious pairing, but think about it -

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,836
she's closely identified with Bath in the 19th century,
and that was the last time Dave had one!

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,037
Come on!

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,753
I just thought I'd check it out. You know, I never had much of
an education what with being an orphan and going to art college.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,480
- Thought I might learn something.
- Of course. Silly of me.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,396
After all, you've always been a big fan of penetrating
19th-century observations of middle-class manners.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,936
I mean, just because you own a T-shirt
advertising the rock band 'Colostomy Explosion'

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,951
doesn't mean you're
not a master of erudition!

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,199
Ah look, just stick it in the oven, come and
join us, and we'll have it when we get back.

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,830
- Two days I've spent preparing this!
- Kryten, I've gotta go, man.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,913
They're waiting for me. Sorry.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,472
I don't know why I bother.
Gallivanting off like that!

cyberschool, I used to spend all my time here.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,119
These strides are too tackle-tight,
Officer BB. I can barely cruise!

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,477
Just try and appreciate the nuance and culture.

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,077
I'm trying, but it's real hard when there's
a seam splicing your nadgers in two!

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,312
- You're gonna spoil this, aren't you?
- No, he won't, he'll be fine.

61
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,997
Look man, all clothes were a bit nadger-restricting back
in them days. That's why there were so many wars.

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,151
OK? Let's interact with the characters,

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,554
then perhaps you can begin to understand
why the book is such a masterpiece.

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,950
Ah! Good morning, Mrs Bennet.
Is it not a most fine day?

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,759

- Oh, please, Mama, can they come?
- May they? Oh, that would be so delightful!

Oh, yes! Oh, please! Do! Do come to tea!

Perhaps I didn't make myself clear?
I said supper is ready!

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,160
Is anyone still unclear
as to the supper situation? No? Excellent.

- It's nice, Kryts. Really nice.
- (KOCHANSKI) It's really great.

- In fact, it's better than nice, it's fantastic.
- Isn't it great?

- It's really great.
- Really really great.

Are we eating the same stuff?

appreciates the hours I put into food prep.

- Any what?

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,118
Ketchup. I just thought it could do
with a bit of ketchup. Just a dollop?

100
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,311
- Ketchup?
- Oh, my God.

101
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,551
- You want ketchup?
- Um... brown!

102
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,234
Not tomato! Brown! It's not like I've got no class.

103

104
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,314
It's really nice, Kryts, but you know me!
I just thought it could do with a bit of a pep up.

do this, Cat do that." What am I? A dog?

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,390
There. I think that's it. Boot him up.

111
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,670
- You're sure you know what you're doing?
- Hey.

Ketchup? With lobster?! You want...

113
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,356
I thought you said you
knew what you were doing!

114
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,958
No, I just said "Hey".

115
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,830
If you'd let me finish the whole sentence,
it would've been "Hey! No, I don't."

116
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,314
- Any luck?
- We've been back and forth through his core program

117
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,471
and as far as we can tell nothing's wrong.

118
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,310
- Maybe worth testing it with one of his spare heads?
- What spare heads?

119
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,511
We've blown them all out.

120
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,959
Look at it. Have you ever seen so many blackheads
outside the staffroom of a fried chicken franchise?

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,394
We managed to save his RAM chips, so at least we've
got his personality on disk, but that's about it.

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,833
Life without a head.
That's gonna put a real crimp on his lifestyle.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,834
- I mean, what can you do without a head?
- Apart from being you? Hardly anything.

124
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,081
We're gonna have to get
him another one somehow.

125
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:39,194
I should've been looking out for
him. How could I let this happen?

126
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,598
When was the Centauri built?
Maybe they had a mechanoid service unit?

127
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,556
- Think. Any clues when it was built?
- Which century?

128
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,950
It had those big crystalline turbine drives.
I'd say 21st or 22nd century...

129
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,076
maybe even 23rd or 24th.

130
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,751
At the outside, 25th, 26th or 27th.
But don't hold me to it.

131
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,048
Why are you asking his advice?

132
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,318
Let's at least ask someone who's going to
give us a slightly more intelligent opinion...

133
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,756
Hello, wall! What do you think?

134
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,958
Hang on. Hang on.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,230
- What are you doing?
- Logging onto their mainframe.

136
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,796
If there's a Divadroid signature
on their supplies inventory,

137
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,396
then it's possible there's some mech-heads
around there somewhere.

138
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,551
Maybe 29th.

139
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,994
Look!

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,358
Hey... Simulant, probably rogue.
Let's get the smeg outta here!

141
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,638
Wait!

142
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,718
(LISTER) Hmm, you smell good.
(CAT) Thanks!

143
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,676
- They're all missing their primers.
- Well, this Johnny won't help us.

144
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,789
Simulants hate everything human or humanoid.
In fact, anything beginning with "hu".

145
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,669
Probably hate the third largest city
in Vietnam, then!

146
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,515
- Why's that?
- Because it's called Hue, dummy.

147
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,197
Actually, it's pronounced "hwah" but if I'd
said "hwah" it wouldn't have been as funny.

148
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,479
Any navigation conference, anywhere, they
would be in the aisles with a quip like that.

149
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,395
Probably trying to get out the building
before you quipped again.

150
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,476
Well, the point I was trying to make was that
Sims hate humans but they don't hate Gelfs.

151
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,917
- But we're not Gelfs.
- We could be.

152
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,309
- This is nuts!
- We look great! What are you talking about?

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,115
- This is never gonna work.
- Achachachachach ach-ach?

154
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,112
Hachachachach! Achachach!

155
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,635
- You can't speak Gelf.
- Neither can the Sim!

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,193
We'll just do an impression of you first thing
in the morning and we'll be fine. Come on, boy.

157
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,431
(LISTER) This is so demeaning.
I feel like a piece of meat!

158
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,875
There's someone up there!
Hachachachach! Achachach!

159
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,793
Achachachachach ach-ach-ach?

160
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,237
It's worse than
the Chronic Catarrh Sufferers' annual outing!

161
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:39,011
- Achachachachach?
- After spare mech-heads, eh?

162
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,716
Human! Lovely with a bit of mint sauce!
How about a trade?

163
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,438
We ain't selling, OK?
Fuel, supplies, anything, but not the human.

164
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,433
- Achachachachach!
- I was just telling him. No deal.

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,797
- Achachachachach!
- Like she says, no deal.

166
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,031
- Achachachach!
- You tell him, bud-babe!

167
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,237
No deal! You got that?

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,398
So... you speak Earth, eh?

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,599
Ach.

170
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,976
Now... Tails, you can have
the mech-heads for free.

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,073
- Heads, I take the human.
- Hey, wait a minute!

172
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,916
It's tails. The heads are yours.

173
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,399
And here are the primers.

174
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,998
Now, how about a toast, eh?

175
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,677
To Simulants, the greatest
droids in the universe!

176
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,997
But never trust 'em, eh? Cheers!

177
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,831
Ah! (LAUGHS)

178
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,316
- Oh, we've been set up!
- But how?

179
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,356
He must have had a sidekick. He kept us
talking while his mate ransacked the ship!

180
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,113
Kryten!

181
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,799
They've taken his RAM chip too.

182
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,113
Little job for you, Able.
Looks like a negadrive blowback.

183
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,274
- Oh, wow! Another mech.
- Yeah, fix him ready for market

184
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,155
or I'll apply the electro-leads
to your nipple nuts.

185
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,914
Fix him or get fried nipple nuts?

186
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,916
Erm... Er... I think I'm gonna choose
the fix him option! Deal!

187
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,550
And hurry it up, you stupid zoney!

188
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,831
Is now a good time to
ask about a pay rise?

189
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,038
I'm almost out of otrazone.
I need some more.

190
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,034
Fix the mech first. Here's his RAM chip.

191
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,112
(GRUNTS)

192
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,391
Totally tubular!

193
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,277
(BLEEPS)

194
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,592
Goodness me! What a peculiar experience.

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,559
Thank you, Mr, er, Mr,
er... What is your name?

196
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,469
Er, just give me a second, OK? Hmph.

197
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,591
I've just sent that query down to long-term
memory retrieval. It'll be back in no time. Hmph.

198
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,673
Hang on. Here it comes. Hmmph.

199
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,309
Told you it would be quick. Hmmmmph.

200
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,189
Able. My name's Able. A-B-L-E, Able.

201
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,153
My name is Kryten. You're a
4000 series, too, aren't you?

202
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,518
Er, hang on. Won't take a tick. Hmmph!

203
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,354
Please, don't bother.
Believe me, you are a 4000.

204
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,235
Well, I could check.
It'd only take about 20 seconds. Hmmph.

205
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,554
Your serial number's 2X4C. I'm a 2X4C too!
We must have the same motherboard.

206
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,596
Oh, then you're my bro!
Hey, wow, you wanna try some otrazone?

207
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,950
Otrazone's dangerous and highly addictive!

208
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,790
I just use it every now and then, you know.
It helps me get through the day.

209
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,476
- Well, how come you ended up here?
- Er, hang on.

210
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,951
- Hmmmmmph!
- What an irritating characteristic.

211
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,950
Uh! OK. The ship I was on,
well, er- kind of crashed a bit.

212
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,879
- "Crashed a bit"?
- All the crew just lay there

213
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,077
and they didn't talk to me any more.

214
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,710
After a couple of years,
I figured out they must be dead.

215
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,271
A long time later, the Simulant
guy came and picked me up.

216
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,434
He's a bit of a psychopathic killing
machine, but he has his good side.

217
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,232
And he has a huge stash of otrazone!
You sure you won't try some, Kryten, bro?

218
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,070
I am not your bro, and I do not touch
otrazone! It corrupts your circuit boards!

219
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,636
Well, that's what people say,
but where's the evidence?

220
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,111
Have I just said that?

221
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,278
Approaching the Centauri,
80 klicks and closing. Nice and easy, man.

222
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,035
Hang on. Their retros have started up.
They've spotted us!

223
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,117
Look at the acceleration of that thing!
They're already halfway across the sector!

224
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,358
The Centauri can travel at
speeds that we can only dream of.

225
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,077
Most ice cream vans can travel
at speeds we can only dream of.

226
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,750
We're never gonna catch them now.
We've lost Kryten.

227
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,319
OK, turn the thrusters to maximum speed
on a bearing Q-2-3 stroke J-8-0.

228
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,595
This is the opposite direction
from Centauri, full speed!

229
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,831
- Precisely.
- Why do we wanna do that?

230
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,793
- It's totally insane.
- (LISTER) So why do we wanna do it, then?

231
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,511
The only reason I can think of is if we'd planted something
on the Centauri and we knew it was gonna blow any second.

232
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,857
(CAT) But we haven't.

233
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:12,436
No we haven't. But explain this, if we haven't why
are we in such a rush to get the hell out of here?

234
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,591
- (CAT) It doesn't make sense.
- Exactly.

235
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,878
- (LISTER) Unless we really have planted a bomb on the Centauri.
- Which we haven't.

236
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,356
So wait a minute. Even though we didn't plant a bomb,

237
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,957
the only thing that really explains what we're doing
is if we did... which we didn't!

238
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,397
But we must have, because
otherwise what we're doing is totally nuts!

239
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,911
- Exactly.
- They've turned around and started tracking us!

240
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,078
What a fluke!

241
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,914
Getting an incoming.
Someone's beaming on board, cargo bay!

242
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,549
We know about the bomb.

243
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,310
So we did plant a bomb!
I was beginning to wonder.

244
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,638
Where did you hide it? Speak!

245
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,799
Or you'll spend the rest of the day picking bits
of charred mech out of your clothing.

246
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,358
- Can I change into dungarees?
- Hand over Kryten and we'll tell you.

247
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,190
Clearly I need to prove myself.

248
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,076
Kryten, that file in your CPU,

249
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,834
the one you've never been able to access.

250
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,870
The password is 4X2C.

251
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,117
Hang on, man. (GRUNTS)

252
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,472
It's about your creator, Kryten, Dr Mamet.

253
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,194
- Kryten, no!
- Accessing now.

254
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,309
No! It can't be true.

255
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,829
- It can't.
- The truth is in there.

256
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,310
That's what turned me into a zoney.

257
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,113
Who's next?

258
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,593
The cat or the woman?
Choose. Heads or tails?

259
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,194
Heads!

260
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,439
Right, let's send them back to their ship and get the
hell outta here before they get their smeg together!

261
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,711
Kryten, man, what's wrong?

262
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,555
You look sadder than the salad you get
with a takeaway shami kebab.

263
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,236
- Tell me what you found out about your creator.
- I can't, sir. It's too terrible.

264
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,558
Kryten, me and you are amigos. You've gotta tell me.

265
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,229
- Well, you keep secrets from me, sir.
- Like what?

266
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,074
- What about your nickname when you were at school?
- What nickname?

267
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,914
- I know what it was.
- I don't think so, no one knows that.

268
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,960
Well, I'm afraid that's just not true, Fatboy.
You talk in your sleep.

269
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,670
It was for a couple of years! 11
to 13 when I living with me gran.

270
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,992
She was massive. Her stockings
used to rub together when she walked.

271
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,996
When she was in a hurry it sounded like
a steam train pulling out of a station.

272
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,676
I started getting fat, too.
It really hit home when she died.

273
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,596
She got knocked down by this truck, and the chalk outline
guy had to go back to the car for a second piece of chalk!

274
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,479
I thought, "I don't want to end
up like that. Double-chalker."

275
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,271
If you ever tell Kris or the Cat this, you're in pieces.
Now tell me about your creator.

276
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,035
- Oh, it's so humiliating!
- Tell me about Professor Mamet.

277
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,310
Well, she was due to marry John Warburton,
a fellow bio-engineer.

278
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,600
He jilted her the day before their wedding,
so she decided to create a droid in his image -

279
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,551
a pompous, ridiculous-looking,
mother-hen-clucking, irascible buffoon.

280
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,635
- What happened to this droid?
- That droid, sir, is me!

281
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,431
Pompous? Ridiculous-looking?
Mother-hen-clucking?

282
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
Oh, yeah. I see now.

283
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
We're all John Warburton,
sir, the entire 4000 series.

284
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,191
It was Mamet's revenge.

285
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,519
Well, judging from the length of your groinal attachment,
you can see why she was so sad to lose him.

286
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,839
As part of the joke,
all my negative emotions - jealousy, anger -

287
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,516
are stored on a special file, my negadrive.

288
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,594
Now, when this file gets full it blows!
Just like he used to.

289
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,320
All your resentment's in this thing? It's so small.

290
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,633
Oh, don't be fooled by that, sir. This box
contains the greatest concentration

291
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,589
of anger, jealousy and resentment
outside a BAFTA awards ceremony!

292
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,556
So Able felt betrayed, lost all his
self-esteem and turned to otrazone.

293
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,239
He told me. He's promised to quit.

294
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,516
How could Mamet have done this?

295
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,799
Kryten, you may have started out
as a joke, but you've grown, you've changed.

296
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,080
Look how different you are to Able. If Mamet came
in here now I bet she wouldn't even recognise you.

297
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,629
- I've evolved?
- You bet.

298
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,110
I've become something that's beyond a joke?

299
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,271
Too right, man.

300
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,833
There's something coming in
from the starboard bow!

301
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,158
- The Sim's back. He's got a lock on!
- Reverse thrust. Go! Five-niner-seven.

302
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,516
- (BOOM)
- Missed, but still locked on!

303
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,957
- Right, I'm taking us into that asteroid belt.
- Oh, not an asteroid belt!

304
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,377
Is that a problem?

305
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:11,194
It sure is! Everything tips from side
to side and my hair gets all messed up!

306
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,951
- So what do we do? Stay here and get splattered?
- Rather that than me looking like Tina Turner!

307
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,674
- I'm taking us in.
- Once we're in the belt,

308
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,117
we'll have to maintain ship and engine
silence 'til he's convinced we're not there.

309
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,752
I know you're in that belt somewhere.

310
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,353
One little mistake... and you're mine.

311
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,471
(ENGINES ROAR)

312
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,476
The mistake is made.

313
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,311
What happened, man?

314
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,793
- I don't know! I don't know nothin'!
- Get him out of here!

315
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,957
Leave him to me!

316
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,430
(ABLE CHUCKLES)
I think I may have pressed the wrong button.

317
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,916
You have jeopardised the lives of the entire crew,

318
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,515
breaking the most basic, fundamental command codes!

319
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,190
I'm sorry. I didn't mean nothin'.

320
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,635
- This dude's real mad. We don't stand a chance!
- I can't throw him off, nothing's working.

321
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,079
- I'm using every trick I know to distract him!
- Pity we can't all moon out of the starboard portholes!

322
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,800
That always works for me!

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,389
Wait! Someone's left the ship, an escape pod!

324
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,511
- It's Able!
- It's heading towards the Sim's ship.

325
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,315
Why, that slimy,
double-crossing, two-faced piece of scum!

326
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,993
He's no brother of mine!

327
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,397
- He's fired something at them.
- Some sort of energy field. Looks heavy.

328
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,278
The negadrive! He's used my negadrive energy
and rerouted it through the escape pod's thrusters.

329
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,273
The Simulant ship is
engulfed in all my negativity.

330
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,955
It's all hopeless! Nobody loves me!

331
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,434
I'm so ugly! I never get invited to parties!

332
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,150
I hate this ship!

333
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,711
I hate everything!

334
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,351
Able's pod just crash-landed.

335
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,870
He threw his life away to save
us, and we hardly knew him.

336
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,632
With your permission, sirs, ma'am, I should like
to recover the body and perform last rites.

337
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,191
- Do you need a hand, Kryts?
- He ain't heavy, sir. He's my brother.

338
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,956
Great anniversary party, Kryters.

339
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,310
Curry World! Fan-smeggin'-tastic!

340
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
How utterly splendid!

341
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,357
Mine's the vindaloo, whatever that is.

342
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,678
Mrs Bennet, Jane, Kitty, I beg you
have the omelette with the big chips.

343
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,799
- Curries are an acquired taste.
- Oh, nonsense!

344
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,430
Mr Darcy didn't think Jane
would enjoy French apples,

345
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,036
but she did, didn't you, Jane?

346
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,350
Now tuck in, girls!

347
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,553
I do declare, Mr Lister,
this is most scrumptious!

348
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,878
Oh, Mama, it's the most succulent dish
I've ever tasted!

349
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,118
A most meritorious venture.

350
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,315
(ALL SCREAM)

351
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,909
Curious. There must be some kind of bug in the program.

352
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,673
- I'm on fire!
- Water!

353
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,434
- Somebody help me!
- Don't worry, sir, I'll work on it.

354
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,073
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

355
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,471
# I'm all alone, more or less

356
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,871
# Let me fly far away from here

357
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,997
# Fun, fun, fun

358
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,390
# In the sun, sun, sun

359
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,837
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

360
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,231
# Drinking fresh mango juice

361
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,518
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

362
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,354
# Fun, fun, fun

363
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,195
# In the sun, sun, sun

364
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,034
# Fun, fun, fun

365
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,398
# In the sun, sun, sun #
