Hello? Yes!

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,750
OK. Here we go. Ship's log...um...one.

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,593
I've decided to keep a journal of life
on-board ship and send it off in a probe.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,196
Since turning 28,
I feel a new maturity about myself.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,593
In fact, I can't even remember the last time
I tried to urinate on Rimmer from the top of D-deck...

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,435
No, wait a minute - Friday.
But apart from that one lapse,

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,399
Maturity wise, I'm practically
up there with Abe Lincoln and Moses.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,589
Now, just recently we came across a craft,
piloted by ourselves from 15 years into the future.

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,197
We had a bit of an argument,
and they attacked us. See attached...

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,389
There may be a what? A way out of this?
Is that what you were going to say?

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,474
S...speak, Kryten.
How can we change what's happening?

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,794
We were no match. They killed us

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,157
and destroyed everything onboard ship,
including the Time Drive,

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,950
which meant there was no Time Drive for them
to have in the future to bring back into the past

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,430
to destroy the future of their
past selves in the present.

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,114
Put simply, by killing us they
killed themselves,

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,033
because once we were dead it was impossible
for us to become them in the future

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,875
and return in time to kill ourselves
in the past even though it was the present.

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,114
Have you been trying to explain about
our future selves again, sir?

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,750
- I just thought I'd have one more go.
- That's the third camera this week!

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,389
The machines just can't take it, sir.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,797
But I'm only trying to explain why Starbug's
damaged despite the timeline being erased

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,476
because this reality's unstable and anomalies have
merged from both dimensions to cope with the paradox.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,398
Oh! Garbled, confusing

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,440
and, quite frankly, duller than an
in-flight magazine produced by Air Belgium.

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,031
Now, just state our position
and explain we're down on supplies.

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,271
All right! All right!

This is Dave Lister
of the JMC transport vehicle Starbug.

(LISTER) Ship's log update, Friday am.

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,918
The battle with our future selves
has had the most terrible consequence.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,793
Wiped out? Kryten, man, they can't be.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,631
I'm afraid so, sir. The laser cannon breached
the main water tank and flooded Supply Deck B.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,030
- They didn't stand a chance.
- Yeah, but surely...

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,390
There was nothing we
could do to save them, sir.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
So, you mean...

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,230
now we've got no poppadoms at all?

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,394
No poppadoms, no curries...
All the Indian food supplies have been totalled.

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,277
I'll have to survive without them, then.

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,398
- I'll have salads.
- Sir, you're in shock.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,831
- You don't know what you're saying.
- After all, it's only curry.

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,475
Oh "only curry", the
enormity of it hasn't sunk in.

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,950
You must mourn, sir. Don't
you see? You must mourn.

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,959
- Me curries.
- Oh, sir.

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,430
Get it out. Cry like a baby.

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,878
What am I gonna do? Curry night
was the one little beacon I had.

64
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,035
It made me feel like a normal ordinary guy,
not some sad freak stuck in deep space -

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,670
no woman, no hope, no curry.

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,153
Worse still, a choice of only two alcoholic
beverages - Cinzano Bianco or advocaat.

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,312
- It's a human tragedy.
- No lager?!

68
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,235
Sir, there is nothing unmanly
in howling like a hungry prairie dog.

69
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,030
- No Lager?!
- All the supplies on B-deck were destroyed, sir.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,192
There wasn't even any wreckage, no debris, zip.

71
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,390
God... A few beers and a curry,
it was the highlight of my week!

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,036
I used to look forward
to curry night, too, sir.

all happy and smiling.

74

Come rain or shine, we'd always make time
for curry night every Friday.

- Saturday.
- Sunday.

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,917
- Tuesday.
- Wednesday.

77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,711
And Thursday. Always the same meal -
three poppadoms with mango chutney.

78
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,030
- Those little onions.
- Dill pickle.

79
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,318
That Day-Glo green mint sauce
that just doesn't wash out.

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,031
- And that weird red stuff that no one knows what it is.
- Then a shami kebab starter.

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,070
Followed by a chicken vindaloo, kamikaze hot,
with a fire extinguisher on standby.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,595
And two scoops of kulfi ice-cream.

83
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,956
And two indigestion tablets.

84
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,351
Oh, life without curry?

85
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,591

Sir...

88
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,798
Perhaps you could learn to love pasta?

89
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,670
Pasta? You sick?

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,675
You know the news?
All the curry supplies have been destroyed.

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,917
We heard.

92
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,551
As a mark of respect, we thought on Sunday at
12 o'clock we could have a minute's flatulence.

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,789
It's nothing to you guys, is it?
Curries were my life.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,510
God, some of the nights! I remember
once on planet leave on Orion,

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,053
I drank a yard of vindaloo sauce, you
know out of one of those long glass tubes?

96
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:10,361
And then went out on
the pull. It was a bet.

97
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:15,073
It's impossible for mechanoids to vomit, sir,
I believe it is safe for you to continue.

98
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,075
I went to this club, the Crazy Astro,
started dancing with this Space Corps nurse.

99
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,311
- Couldn't hear her name.
- Fido, was it?

100
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,791
- Lassie, possibly?
- She was very attractive, actually, Rimmer.

101
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,990
Very short skirt, little ankle bracelet, took out her chewing
gum before she ate her chicken in a basket. You know, class.

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,198
All right, so she had teeth that
looked like six half-open garage doors,

103
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,035
but it was nothing a cosmetic
surgeon couldn't fix in ten minutes.

104
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,114
- So what happened?
- I went over to her, leant in close,

105
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,918
asked her to dance...

106
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,994
- For a few seconds, she didn't answer.
- She was probably concussed.

107
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,597
A yard of vindaloo sauce? You must have had
breath that could shear sheep.

108
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,350
- We started to snuggle up...
- I'm not sure I want to hear any more of this.

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,598
Then all of a sudden... a rumbling in me stomach.

110
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,239
AlI I can remember is running.
Across the dance floor, through the crowd.

111
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
- Just made it.
- So you didn't get off with her?

112
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,392
Only thing I got off was
the loo about six hours later.

113
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,793
When I got back to the dance floor, everyone
was gone. They had to wait for me to lock the club!

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,954
God, nearly put me off curries for life. In fact, I
didn't have another one until the following night.

115
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,790
What an enchanting little tale.

116
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,798
Well, if you'll excuse me I'm just off to
glug a couple of yards of vindi sauce,

117
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,591
then if we do happen to chance across
'Planet of the Snooty Sex Sirens', I can't miss.

118
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,714
Sirs, I suggest we carry out
a thorough inspection of the ship.

119
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,760
The altercation with our future selves
caused dimensional anomalies

120
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,515
which have expanded the cargo deck by 212%.

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,274
We should ascertain that
the new structures are stable.

122
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,275
(CAT) Time has returned to the point before
we discovered the time machine, right?

123
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,037
So what's to stop us going back on board the
Gemini 12 and picking it up all over again?

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
We have to avoid all forms of time travel.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,278
It's the only way of breaking our destiny line and
ensuring we don't end up like our future selves.

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,016
Yeah, but surely we can use
the Time Drive if we're careful?

127
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,879
You know, if we don't abuse it
in the way our future selves did?

128
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,271
- You know, if we're sensible and mature.
- And do what?

129
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,354
Go back in time to an Indian
takeaway and order 500 curries.

130
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,990
Sir, the scheme is irresponsible,
moronic and preposterous!

131
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,151
All your hallmarks, bud!

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,279
One really big takeaway order once every
two years and our problems are over.

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,353
YOUR problems are over.
OUR problems are just beginning.

134
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,070
What about causality? Interfering
in the past, no matter how minutely,

135
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,834
always alters the present - cause and effect.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Look, I'm a curry-aholic!
I've only got two taste buds that work.

137
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
I need curry.

138
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,391
We can't afford to take any more chances.
I say the Time Drive stays where it is.

139
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,555
You know I'd rather wear sideways-pressed flares
and a clip-on polyester tie than agree with Goalpost Head,

140
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,711
but this time he's right.

141
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,917
Oh, OK. OK.

142
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,874
(KRYTEN) Since that completes
the B-deck inspection, sirs,

143
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,551
permission to off-line for the next 12 hours
while I discard some old cache files?

144
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,950
How come you need more memory?

145
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,795
Over the years, you've had more RAM
than a field of sheep.

146
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,998
My head is littered
with unnecessary information, sir.

147
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,527
The ability to sing the Bay City Rollers'
greatest hits is no longer a priority.

148
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:40,918
For the most cultural purposes, crooning
"Bye Bye, Baby" is more than sufficient.

149
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,469
This clean-up thing, how does it work, exactly?

150
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,669
I simply attach my RAM to the ship's computer
and download the unwanted files into its trash file.

151
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,879
Your RAM's in your head, isn't it?
So you won't actually be using your body, then?

152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,509
- Why do you ask?
- Just interested.

153
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,354

I can't go behind Kryten's head.
What would he say if he found out?

161
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,076
It's deceitful, wrong and dishonest.

I've longed to experience,

177
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,754
So, um...Kryten,
now that you've had time to think,

178
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,275
what about that curry
hunt to the 22nd Century?

179
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,150
Ooh, I meant to mention that, yes. I overreacted yesterday.
On reflection, I think it'd be quite safe.

180
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,675
- Safe?
- What about causality?

181
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,838
Causality? Well, OK, you know,
one event causes another, OK

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,200
but sometimes, you just gotta say,
"The laws of time and space? Who gives a smeg?"

183
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,954
Ah, I think what Kryten's
trying to say here is...

184
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,993
- You're smoking!
- Oh, is my generator overheating again?

185
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,634
- A cigarette.
- D'you want one?

186
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,189
- Of course I don't want one!
- D'you want me to go outside?

187
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,274
I think what Kryten's trying to say
is that it's OK to go back in time

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,432
and order a small lake's worth
of vindaloo to go, isn't that right?

189
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,156
- You bet your ass!
- OK, so let's navigate those reality bubbles and do it.

190
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,159
Kryten, can I have a word?

191
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,679
Look, what is wrong with you? You don't smoke,
you never say "bet your ass",

192
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,231
and you never use your groinal
attachment to stir anybody's tea!

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,678
- I didn't get any error commands.
- Yeah, because you've got no behaviour protocols, ya spanny

Do you think it's because the sub-space conduits
have locked with the transponder calibrations

314
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,199
and caused a major tachyon surge
that has overloaded the time matrix?

315
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,239
No, sir. I've just been jabbing it too hard.

316
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,391
So what now?

317
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,313
We need to have time to work out how to unfreeze it.

319
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,234
I'm on my way, sir!

320
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,319
How can the same guy be an icon in one reality

321
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,871
and a criminal in the next
for doing exactly the same things?

322
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,119
- In one reality, he wasn't caught.
- Yeah, but was he a good guy or not a good guy?

323
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,597
- Both.
- But somewhere along the way, just like me,

324
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,752
he disabled his guilt chip
and discarded his behaviour protocols.

325
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,355
- Power corrupts.
- Is it true?

326
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,797
- Can you be two things simultaneously?
- Take you, sir.

327
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,634
In some ways,
you're bright, sensitive and caring.

328
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,196
In other ways, you're an irresponsible,
curry-obsessed moron.

329
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,109
Thanks, Kryten. That's... Wow, yeah.

330
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,671
It's hopeless. I can't fix it. We're trapped.

331
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,714
- Chicken's good.
- Yeah, yeah, it's really good.

332
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,273
- That's not chicken, sirs.
- Oh, what is it?

333
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,756
It's that man we found. It's Eric.

334
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,954
- What?
- Well, it seemed such a waste

335
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,590
to just leave him lying there
when he'd barbecue so beautifully.

336
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,839
- (SNIGGERS)
- Did I do wrong? I didn't get any error commands.

337
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,513
Obviously, I thought about it because without my guilt
chip or moral imperatives I had nothing to guide me.

338
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,951
But it seemed to me
that if humanoids eat chicken,

339
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,114
then obviously they'd eat their own species,
otherwise they'd just be picking on the chickens.

340
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,115
One minute you're down,
the next you're right back up again.

341
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,071
- I just said I was enjoying that.
- I knew it didn't smell right! Oh, my God!

342
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,752
- I'm a cannibal!
- (BLEEPING)

343
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,879
- Look!
- Right, let's get out of here!

344
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,954
I badly need to floss a piece of
roasted dead person out of my teeth!

345
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,911
- Where to?
- Ah, Hawaii. Let's catch some surf.

346
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,360
No. No. We've got to go back and stop ourselves
interfering with the assassination.

347
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,199
I don't care where we go,
as long as it's before we had dinner!

348
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,794
- Decorators.
- Try up on the sixth floor.

349
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,876
Isn't this sick, I mean just standing by
and allow the president to be killed?

350
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,716
- Not if you're Eric White it ain't.
- To think, Eric's out there right now

351
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,909
without any idea that one day he'll become a
between-meals snack that does ruin your appetite.

352
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,794
Unless we put things back the way they were.

353
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,796
Stand back, sir,
our original selves are about to beam in.

354
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,319
When they realise their mistake they'll beam
out again. I propose we go down to the fourth.

355
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,037
- (GUNSHOT)
- First shot!

356
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,032
- It doesn't smell right. I think he's missed.
- How come?

357
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,714
He's right, sir, by sending Oswald up to the sixth,

358
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,475
we've made the trajectory of his shot
so steep he's only wounded him.

359
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,200
Let's start again and bring
him back down to the fifth.

360
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,149
We can't use the fifth. Our original selves are
destined to beam in there as fires his third shot

361
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,550
and this version of
us is now on the fourth.

362
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,157
We've been copied more times than that poster
of the tennis girl scratching her butt.

363
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,328
If we could arrange
somehow for a second gunman

364
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:31,355
to fire from just behind that little
hill over there, covered in lawn...

365
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,239
You mean the, er... the grassy knoll, sir?

366
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,391
Yeah, that'd solve it, wouldn't it?

367
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,710
Shoot the pres? Who?

368
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,315
- You can count me out.
- Yeah, and me.

369
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,553
Hang on. Maybe, just maybe, there's someone
who can get us out of this mess.

370
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,160
- Where are we going?
- Idlewild Airport, July '65.

371
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,039
(WHOOSH)

372
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:17,192
This is right, he's being escorted to Hoover Open Prison
in New York. Give me five minutes.

373
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,354
(WHOOSH)

374
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,877
Don't be alarmed, sir,
but I have a very strange tale to tell.

375
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,678
I, ah, have had plenty of time
to reflect on my days in the White House.

376
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,231
In all important respects,
I believe I did a good job.

377
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,792
It was right to plan a pull-out of Vietnam,
to fight for civil rights,

378
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,112
and, ah, to fight Congress, ah, to put a man on the Moon.

379
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,038
It was, ah, wrong, however, to, ah, act like an
irresponsible jackass with all those women

380
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,194
and allow my enemies
to wreak havoc on our nation.

381
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,473
But I can help, man...
I mean, Mr President, man... I mean, sir.

382
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,910
And how er, can you help?

383
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,591
Well, come with us back to Dallas,
November 1963, Be a second gunman.

384
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,115
The gunman behind the grassy knoll.

385
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,951
You mean... assassinate myself?

386
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,279
Yeah. It'll drive the conspiracy nuts crazy,
but they'll never figure it out.

387
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,875
But I still have a future here.

388
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:26,389
Jackie left me, but, ah, when I get out,
I can, ah, still make a contribution to the world.

389
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,039
See this airport? Idlewild Airport?

390
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,875
In our reality, they renamed it JFK after you.

391
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,994
Where I come from, you're a liberal
icon, and that's the person you should be.

392
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,551
But if you're gonna be that person,
you gonna have to sacrifice your life.

393
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,591
And only then will my reputation
be restored in history?

394
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,792
Mmm. And I can get a smeggin' curry.

395
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,471
Ask not what your country can do for you...

396
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,519
ask what you can do for your country.

397
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,951
- Hey, that'd make a pretty neat speech, that!
- It did.

398
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,189
I, ah... thank you all for giving me
the opportunity to, ah... be reborn.

399
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,719
Smeg!

400
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,794
I forgot to ask if there are
any curry houses in Dallas!

401
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,511
(CAT WHISTLES NONCHALANTLY)

402
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,271
Aaargh!

403
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,198
Right, Krytie. Same drill.

404
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,829
You measure the output voltage.
I'll note the reading.

405
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,640
Just give me a second to get in position.

406
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,834
Right. In your own time.

407
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,079
Well?

408
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,437
350 volts, sir. Same as the others.

409
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,399
Not that one, then.
Still, we're narrowing it down.

410
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,599
- Just 17 more to go.
- Sir, might I suggest that we use an actual volt meter,

411
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,831
as opposed to, well... using me?

412
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,078
Oooh! Too good to be a
volt meter now, are we?

413
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,631
I dunno, one morning spent
poncing around without your guilt chip

414
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,269
and suddenly you think
you're some hoity-toity robo-god

415
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,273
instead of the lashed-together
Meccano gimboid that you are.

416
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,871
Oh, if you want me to be a volt meter
I'm only too happy to be of service.

417
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,292
Why, if you asked me to remove my
head and turn it into a chemical toilet,

418
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:31,718
complete with working
flush, I'd be equally honoured.

419
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,193
It's just that firing my eyes out of my head at the speed
of sound does invalidate my Divadroid service guarantee.

420
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,960
I would hate to malfunction
and you not get a full refund.

421
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,470
I mean, wouldn't that be so annoying?

422
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,399
I am a total twonk.

423
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,589
How could I be such a saliva-dribbling,
moronic, brain frozen, putzy little smegger?

424
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,996
It's good that book
on self-enlightenment, isn't it?

425
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,397
The curry supplies. There was no debris.

426
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,315
Don't you get it? No little bits of floating
crate? They weren't destroyed in the flood.

427
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,670
Well, what happened to them, then?

428
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,913
I took 'em. At some point in the future,
I must go back to the past

429
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,550
and bring all the curry supplies
to the present. Capisce?

430
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,755
Of course! Oh, it's so simple, even a half
concussed gym teacher could understand it.

431
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,236
This is the last jaunt... I promise.

432
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,797
No, absolutely not. As senior technician on this ship,
I forbid it, d'you hear me? I absolutely forbid it.

433
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,671
(WHOOSHING)

434
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,957
What is the point of me being his superior officer
if he never obeys a single command?

435
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,795
You know, he hasn't even got the good manners to let
me court-martial him. Not even when I ask him nicely.

436
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,834
- We might as well have a melon in command.
- I thought we had, sir.

437
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,631
Oh, I see. Sorry, sir.

438
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,633
The voltage must have corrupted
my comprehension unit.

439
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,633
Stand back!
It sounds like something's coming in.

440
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,189
(WHOOSHING)

441
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:12,594
Yes! This thing is amazing.
If only we could use it to get back to Earth our time.

442
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,112
Sir, you saw the havoc we caused in Dallas
in the first two seconds of our arrival.

443
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,274
Heaven knows what we'd reduce civilisation
to if we lived in the past permanently.

444
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,913
He's right. We don't want anymore idiotic gaffs
until... Think we could make it to half four?

445
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,798
You know, I must have passed this thing
a million times. What the hell's it for?

446
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,069
Oh! Nice going on the idiotic gaffs front, sir.
We almost lasted a full five seconds, there.

447
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,314
Kryten, surely you're not implying that was
accidental? I've had that ace up my sleeve for months.

448
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,629
They're not coming back.

449
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,996
I'm lost in deep space,

450
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,720
over three million years from home.

451
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,475
No life, no bird, no nothin'.

452
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,477
Just me and three and a half tons of curry.

453
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,469
Fan-smeggin'-tastic!

454
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,876
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

455
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,396
# I'm all alone, more or less

456
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,712
# Let me fly far away from here

457
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,599
# Fun, fun, fun

458
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,355
# In the sun, sun, sun

459
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,751
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

460
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,117
# Drinking fresh mango juice

461
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,432
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

462
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,240
# Fun, fun, fun

463
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,155
# In the sun, sun, sun

464
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,960
# Fun, fun, fun

465
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,193
# In the sun, sun, sun #
