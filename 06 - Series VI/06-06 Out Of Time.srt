1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,719
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,394
Gentlemen,
thank you for attending the meeting.

3
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:49,479
Now, let me begin by saying that it
can't have escaped anyone's attention

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,873
that things have been getting
rather strained round here of late.

5
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,356
It's no secret that morale is on the floor.

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,754
We've lost all trace of Red Dwarf,
tempers are strained and supplies are low.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,830
So, I've decided, if it's alright with you,
to appoint myself morale officer...

8
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,354
..and set myself the task of raising the spirits
and improving the atmosphere all round.

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,758
Now, to kick off, I thought it would
be productive if we all met once a week

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,470
to have a coffee or a beer,
whatever's your poison,

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,275
and get any problems
we may have off our chests.

12
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,319
- Any objections?
- No, it sounds like a very good idea, sir. Excellent.

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,751
Well, as it's week one, why don't I start?

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,517
You know what it is about Lister
that really makes me want to puke?

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,231
That really makes me want to stab him
in both eyes with an ice pick?

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,755
Everything, that's what.

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,198
Especially his godawful,
chirpy, gerbil-faced optimism.

18
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,479
And as for the Cat, what an unbelievable git.

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
And Kryten, if he doesn't change pronto,

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,391
I swear, I'll attach jump leads to his nipple nuts
and fry him like Cajun catfish.

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,676
Well, I think that's cleared the air.

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,470
I don't know about you but I certainly feel better,
and thank you for your contributions, gentlemen.

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,315
See you at next week's morale meeting.
Marvellous.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,111
- Good meeting.
- What's eating him?

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,075
Well, I'm no psychologist, sir, but maybe
the bleak, lonely, pointless emptiness

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,198
of our hopeless, futile predicament is beginning to getting to him.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,837
You can always tell when he's tense. The way he
scrunches up cups and throws them in the bin.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,356
And we're not talking styrofoam, here.
We're talking enamel.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,871
- I told you, didn't I? That he attacked me with that fridge?
- What happened?

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,795
He just wrenched it off the
wall and tried to insert it in me.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,000
What did you do to upset him?

32
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,631
Absolutely nothing. I was just
sitting there, minding my own business,

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,872
plucking out my lengthier nostril
hairs with a pair of cooking tongs.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,436
- Extraordinary. It's so unprovoked.
- The guy's so touchy.

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,073
If I tried to force feed you a refrigerator every time you
did something gross, you'd have to go on a fridge-free diet.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,320
You know what the problem is? Every day's the
same old slog through deep space. No Variety.

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,275
- Take Christmas. What did we do Christmas Day?
- If you remember, sir, Christmas Day we were attacked

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,229
by that pan-dimensional liquid beast
from the Mogidon Cluster.

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,516
Maybe that wasn't such a great example.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,314
I'm trying to say our lives are dull, repetitive.

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,519
We never take time out to smell the roses.
We never celebrate anything.

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,877
- We got nothing to celebrate with, bud.
- Oh, not true, sir.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,752
There's a whole case of that wine I brewed
out of urine recyc just lying there, practically untouched.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,750
Look, call me pretentious, but, for me, a truly great wine should not leave you

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,436
with a foam moustache
that you can only remove with turps.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,677
- (SIREN)
- Autopilot alert.

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,877
- Storm front ahead. Switching to manual.
- It's a big one. Too late to go round! It's right on us.

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,118
Stellar fog, tightly-packed particles
from an exploded supernova.

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,840
Our scanners won't be able to
penetrate more than a few metres.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,916
Slowing to minimum.

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,113
Gentleman, absolute concentration
till we're through the squall.

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,319
- There could be anything lurking out there.
- Don't worry, bud. If there's anything out there, we'll spot it.

53
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:10,640
(BOOM)

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,792
- Anybody hurt?
- Well, my pride sure needs mouth-to-mouth.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,719
Mr Lister! Sir!

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,352
- He's out cold!
- All stop. Let's get him up to the obs room.

57
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,675
- (RIMMER) How is he?
- Not good, sir. Perhaps you better look away.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,198
- I know you can't stand the sight of blood.
- Don't worry, Kryten. It's OK when it's Lister's.

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,516
- Impossible!
- (CAT) What?

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,672
Look! Mr Lister is a droid!

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,431
- He's a what?!
- There's no doubt about it.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,913
He's entirely mechanical.
A 3000 Series. Made in Taiwan.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,755
Look, he has a 24-hour emergency call-out number.

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,959
I'm sorry, I'm not buying this.
I mean, who'd create him and why?

65
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,795
What's his mission?
To rid the universe of chicken vindaloo?

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,197
This doesn't tie up. If he wasn't
human, I'd've known by his scent.

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,630
The X-rays confirm it.

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,676
This is so strange.
Mr Lister's always been an icon of mine.

69
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,277
Now I find he's an earlier model
and technically, I outrank him!

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,751
An earlier model? Then how come he looks
so much more sophisticated than you?

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,118
Sir, just because I have a head shaped
like a freak formation of mashed potato

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,271
does not mean I am unsophisticated.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,556
Alright then, why does he look
more realistically human?

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,832
Humans have always found
exact duplicates rather disturbing, sir.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,719
The 3000 Series was notoriously unpopular.

76
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,351
Most of them were recalled. A few slipped the net
and went undercover to make new lives in society.

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,915
- Do you think he knows?
- Unlikely.

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,794
He probably reprogrammed his
own memory to escape detection.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,437
This is going to crack him up, devastate him.
Who's going to tell him?

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,718
I'll write you into my will if you let it be me.

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,959
I suggest you leave this to me, sirs.
I'll have a talk with him, droid to droid.

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,318
OK. we'll get going, try and get out of this
damn fog before it drains our solar batteries.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,756
(GROANS)

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,350
- What happened? What hit us?
- Something in the stellar fog, sir.

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,196
It didn't show up on the scans.
Sir, do you remember who your parents were?

86
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,314
No, you know I don't. I was
found under a pool table in a box.

87
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,911
Hmm. Did anyone ever tell you
what was written on that box?

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,075
Were the words "kit" or "paint
before assembing" ever mentioned?

89
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,677
It's just while you were under, we discovered
something rather disturbing about you.

90
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,874
It's that tattoo on my inner thigh, isn't it?

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,670
Look, I don't really love Petersen. He just got
me so drunk, I didn't know what I was doing.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,919
It's not the tattoo, sir.
There's no way of breaking this gently.

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,835
I'm afraid, sir, you are not human.
You're a droid.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,311
- I'm a what?
- You're a mechanical, 3000 Series.

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,439
- Technically subordinate to me.
- What does this all mean?

96
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,034
In broad terms, I get the front seat in the cockpit
and you're in charge of the laundry!

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,510
And I want to see creases!

98
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,631
Kryten, have a heart, man. I'm in major
stress-related shock here. Gobsmack overload.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,714
You're a droid. You don't have real emotions.
It's just synthi-shock.

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,599
Now stop thinking like a
human, and go about your duties.

101
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,350
- Kryten, why are you being so heartless?
- I looked up to you.

102
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,479
You encouraged me to break my
programming and ape human behaviour.

103
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,759
Now I find you're no better than I!
But worst of all, the most bitter pill to swallow...

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,869
for four long years, I had to hand-scrub
the gussets of your longjohns!

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,604
Now, unless you want to wallow
in the eternal fires of Silicon Hell,

106
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,992
I suggest you bring a tray of
refreshments up to the cockpit, pronto!

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,058
What was the jolt?

108
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:51,278
It's a mystery, bud. Nothing on
the scanners. Nothing on visual.

109
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,110
It was like we through some kind of energy pocket. Still, looks like we're out of it now.

110
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,836
Better run a cross-check, see if this
phenomena is mentioned in any of our databases.

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,595
Tea up! Sorry I was so long, I
didn't know where anything was.

112
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,071
Let me see that tray, please.

113
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,119
- Why?
- That's, "Why, Mr Kryten, sir?"

114
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,831
You call those triangular sandwiches?
Did you use a set square? I think not!

115
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,120
And the chocolate finger display is laughable.

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,430
Don't just pile them higgledy-piggledy onto the plate.

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,230
Make them into an attractive interlaced,
log cabin structure or something.

118
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,598
This just will not do. Now, kindly return to the galley and start again.

119
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,038
OK... sir. This doesn't feel right.
Not right at all.

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,396
What a charlatan. All these years...

121
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,638
- Any ideas what hit us yet?
- Wait. Wait, here's something.

122
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,873
Reports of artificial stellar fogs
which contain reality minefields.

123
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,919
- Reality what?
- Bubbles or pockets of unreality,

124
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,274
which when encountered create false realities
designed to disorient and drive off potential looters.

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,189
- From what?
- It's a defence device fitted to Space Corps test ships,

126
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,719
which are fitted with prototype drives so awesome
in power that they have to be safeguarded at all costs.

127
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,957
So we just crashed through an unreality pocket?

128
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,031
Which created a false reality,
making us believe Mr Lister was... Oh, my.

129
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,595
- You mean he's not a...?
- No.

130
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,750
- Tea up, sirs.
- Sir, I, er...

131
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,959
What do you think of the picket fence?

132
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,032
- I'm not happy with it, meself. I'll go away and do it again.
- Sir, may I see your arm?

133
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,309
Smeg! It looks normal, human!

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,710
Someone else tell him.

135
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,633
I've got gussets to scrub.

136
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,398
I wondered if you felt
like a nice cold beer, sir?

137
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,393
Oh, sir, how many times can I apologise?

138
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,719
I have offered to mince myself.
What more can I do?

139
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,839
Don't worry, I'll think of something,
probably involving a bowl of water, a poker,

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,517
a recharge socket
and 4,000 volts of direct current.

141
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,712
This fog's getting worse. I say reverse out now before it's too late.

142
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,078
Well, I hate to agree with old Laundry-Chute Nostrils,
but he has got a point.

143
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,756
The scanners are out,
and my smell range is practically zero.

144
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,598
Starbug is small. We can probably pick our way through
without hitting any more unreality bubbles.

145
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,071
Someone's gone to plenty big trouble
to keep spacecraft out of here.

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,471
- It's gotta be worth finding out why.
- But how can we guarantee we're-?

147
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,353
- (CAT) We hit one!
- (LISTER) We hit one.

148
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,756
- That's what I said.
- Where's the Cat?

149
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,895
- (CAT) I'm here.
- It's taken the Cat, he's gone!

150
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,233
I'm not gone! I'm here!

151
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,398
- They must've just erased him from existence.
- Then how come we still remember him?

152
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,359
- Remember, who?
- I don't remember.

153
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,994
Hey, buds, don't do this to me!
You can't forget me! I'm unforgettable

154
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,915
I don't get this! We're passing through an
unreality pocket, and everything's normal!

155
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,596
What do you mean "everything's
normal"? I've been invisibled!

156
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,658
It doesn't make any sense. All systems
check. The three of us are here as normal.

157
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,634
The four of us! There's four of us! Look! I'm here.
Can't you see me? Can't you feel me?

158
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,593
We're getting some buffeting!

159
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
About to pass back into normal space.

160
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,269
What are you doing?!

161
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
- Can you see me?
- Of course I can see you.

162
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,032
You all forgot who I was. Don't you remember?
It's too weird in here. Let's quit while we can.

163
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,436
All we gotta do is keep our heads.

164
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,359
Boy! This is worse than triple-strength catnip!

165
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,352
The pockets are getting denser
and closer together. We're never going to...

166
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,358
make it.

167
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,176
I can't take
much more of this.

168
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,519
Just ignore it. All these unreality pockets are designed
to make you feel absurd and disoriented.

169
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,274
He's right. Let's just keep going
and we'll get out the other side.

170
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,236
All ahead stop. We have got to talk.
Kryten, how far would you say it is to the epicentre?

171
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,556
Current speeds, about another three days, sir.

172
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,470
- OK, you win. Let's get outta here.
- Perhaps there is one possibility.

173
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,351
That's it. I've installed a temporary
stasis seal on both deep sleep units.

174
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,953
So, in theory at least, time will be frozen, and neither reality
nor unreality will be able to penetrate.

175
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,356
See you in three days.

176
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,951
- Where are we, did we make it?
- We successfully penetrated the minefield, sir.

177
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,680
- We're through to the epicentre.
- But what was it protecting?

178
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,959
A derelict. According to the computer,
it's from the 28th century

179
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,031
and it's capable of time travel?!

180
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,120
- Crew?
- All dead. This was the maiden voyage.

181
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,274
They contracted an influenza virus
on an excursion to the 20th century.

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,512
Before they died, they programmed
the autopilot through deep space.

183
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,992
and generated the minefield to prevent the
machine from falling into the wrong hands.

184
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,671
Does this mean what I think it means?
We board her, strip out the drive and...

185
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,992
Bingo! We've got ourselves a time machine!

186
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,350
Let's see if the sucker works.

187
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,759
Sirs, choose a year.

188
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,878
Since we can't guarantee this time
drive is going to function properly,

189
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,590
I suggest we select a neutral time period for our first jaunt.

190
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,711
He's got a point. Let's go for somewhere
nice and safe and dull. How about 1422?

191
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,998
- How about 1421?
- What's the difference?

192
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,677
No difference. I just wanted it make
it look like I was paying attention.

193
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,471
Load 1421, Kryten.

194
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,792
1421 loaded, sir. August the 17th.
Engaging the time drive.

195
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,475
- Hey, we did it!
- Indeed we did.

196
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,511
All ship chronometers indicate this is August
16th in the year 1421 - just one day out.

197
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,638
- Give us visual, let's see what it's like out there.
- OK, punching it up.

198
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,272
I don't get it. We're still where we were.

199
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,396
Of course. We're still in deep space, sir, only
now we're in deep space in the 15th century!

200
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,633
Isn't it wonderful?

201
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,599
So we're still three million years away from Earth?

202
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,876
Well, yes.

203
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,275
- Taking her back to the present.
- Keyed in. Engaged.

204
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,510
So, forgive me if I'm being thicker

205
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,311
than the offspring
of a village idiot and a TV weathergirl,

206
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,757
but what exactly
was the point of that little exercise?

207
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,756
Fun though it was drinking in the heady
medieval atmosphere of pre-Renaissance deep space,

208
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,991
the drive is next to useless, yes?

209
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,159
For the moment, yes, but should we ever
acquire a faster-than-light drive,

210
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,551
we will have the combination
to travel anywhere and anywhen.

211
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,798
- Picking up a craft.
- He's right. Some kind of craft, small. Here it comes.

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,879
It's a Jupiter Mining Corporation call sign.

213
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,638
Some kind of transport vehicle. Colour: green,
Life-forms: four... Craft name: "Starbug"?

214
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,558
Call me crazy,
but that all sounds weirdly familiar.

215
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,795
It's us, man. Us from the future.
Hey, incoming SOS message!

216
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,037
- Don't punch it up! Close comms!
- Why?

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,034
If that vessel is this vessel, sir. Almost
certainly it contains our future selves.

218
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,476
The implications of making
contact could be devastating.

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,400
The human brain is not designed
to cope with knowing its own future.

220
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,753
Yeah, but Kryten, obviously we're in some kind of
major trouble, otherwise we wouldn't've shown up.

221
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,574
No, Kryten's got a point. It's
too dangerous to make contact.

222
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,511
What if we discover
that one of us is dead?

223
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,436
- Who could handle that?
- We all could if it was you.

224
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,753
They're trying us again. Come on, they're in
trouble, we can't just hang them out to dry!

225
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,912
Well, in that case, sir. Suggest that I am left alone to make contact.

226
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,755
I can give them whatever assistance they require
then erase my memory of the entire event.

227
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,080
Opening comms. Present Starbug calling
future Starbug. We are ready to communicate.

228
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,872
Well, how did it go? Everything OK?

229
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,270
Mr Lister, sir...

230
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,359
I love you!

231
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,839
You know that, don't you? I'd hate you
to... go anywhere not knowing that, sir.

232
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,431
So what's the SP, Kryts?
Can you tell us anything?

233
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,719
A little, sir. They are indeed our
future selves from 15 years hence.

234
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,717
(SOBS) What a senseless waste!

235
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,190
Listen, if something happens to me, I want to know!

236
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,859
All I'm allowed to divulge is that their time drive has developed a fault, and they can only travel forwards.

237
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,391
They jumped to a period where they knew we would be, in order to copy some components from our own drive.

238
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,798
So am I actually going to get to meet me?
My knees have turned to jelly!

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,790
Nobody will be meeting anybody. You must be sealed in
the upper deck before they set a space boot on board.

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,389
- So, when are they coming?
- Immediately.

241
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,598
I'll serve your supper in the ops room.

242
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,071
I thought I'd whip you up a nice little curry
with jam roly-poly

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,390
and a big jug of chilled margarita.

244
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,752
- They're all my favourites!
- (SOBS) I know!

245
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,191
How can we have margeritas? I thought we were out of tequila?

246
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,957
I put a little miniature bottle aside, sir, for...
no particular reason.

247
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,194
And I thought since today had... no special
significance, it would be appropriate to...

248
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,040
- Oh, just go, Kryten!
- Thank you, sir.

249
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,595
(KRYTEN SOBS HYSTERICALLY)

250
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,151
His favourite bowl.

251
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,791
His little cup.

252
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,278
The tin opener he used
to pick his ears clean with.

253
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,076
- Everything OK?
- Oh, yep, yep.

254
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,470
Those darn onions get you every time!

255
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,876
- What onions?
- Er, the onions I'm about to peel.

256
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,112
I always get a little emotional when
I have to deprive an onion of its skin.

257
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,749
Hey, don't Nixon me, man! Tell me the truth.

258
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,356
I die, don't I? I mean, I'm
dead aren't I? I don't make it.

259
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,158
All I'm at liberty to disclose sir, is that all four
members of the Starbug crew will be boarding this vessel.

260
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,558
- Yeah, but I'm not amongst them, right?
- One of their number is called Dave Lister.

261
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,236
Now, you'll have to excuse me. I've already said too much.

262
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,429
Hang on a minute, I'm really
confused now. Are you saying I survive?

263
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,033
I can say no more. Please,
let us not squabble on this of all days.

264
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,790
Careful with them chillies, Kryten. The rate
you're going, there'll be none left for tomorrow.

265
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,710
Look, whatever it is, there's
nothing you can do about it. It's fate.

266
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,949
I just don't get it. Am I dead or am I alive?
If I'm dead, how can I come on-board?

267
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,755
- What precisely are you doing, bud?
- I'm hacking into the security cameras.

268
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,992
Kryten's turned off all the monitors, so I'm rigging it up to the mediscan.

269
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,834
When those johnnies come on board, I wanna see 'em.

270
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,320
Docking complete. Opening airlock 4.
Gentlemen, welcome aboard.

271
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,872
Ah, Mr Rimmer, sir. Come in, come in.

272
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,752
Did we actually used to live like this?
What a godawful, depressing little hole.

273
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,829
We're used to the good things in life now, bud.

274
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,800
- Kryten! Are you really me?!
- Would you take a look at him?

275
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,076
Did I really used to look that goofy?

276
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,239
What is that you've got on your head?
I hope you have a quarantine license for it.

277
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,511
We're time travellers now, and a lot of our
business involves going back in history.

278
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,629
I have to look incognito. Frankly, I can't afford going around
looking like I've swapped heads

279
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,076
with a damaged crash dummy.

280
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,591
I think we're overstepping
the bounds of agreed conversation, here...

281
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,196
Is, um...? Mr Lister, did you bring him?

282
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,229
Sir, you look terrific.
I was expecting something much worse.

283
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,478
Don't worry about me, Kryts, I'm fine.
Absolutely dandy.

284
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,194
Well, blow me! You've hardly changed at all.

285
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,194
If I hadn't been told about the accident,
I don't think I'd even have noticed.

286
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,759
Yo! We're in.

287
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,873
Oh, my God! Look at Rimmer!

288
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,959
- I can't have changed much. I'm a hologram.
- Wrong.

289
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,839
You're two meals away from being a sumo wrestler.

290
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,991
- Let me see!
- Am I there?

291
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,191
- Oh, yes.
- What do I look like?

292
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,639
I can't actually see quite clearly... The light
is reflecting off the top of your head.

293
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,791
What are you talking about?

294
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,833
(LAUGHS) You're as bald as a plucked chicken, man!

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,880
- Let me see!
- Wait, wait. I want to see if I'm there.

296
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,999
I don't seem to be there.
It's just you two, Kryten...

297
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,032
- Oh, my God...
- What? What is it?

298
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,354
Ooooh, dear!

299
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,630
What? Is he fat?

300
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,791
Far from it.

301
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,191
He's lost a bit of weight, actually.

302
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,193
Actually, he's lost quite a little bit of everything.

303
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,871
- What do I do to end up like that?
- That is tragic.

304
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,159
That is the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

305
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,475
What happened to my butt? Buddy,
you could park a plane in that crease.

306
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,194
So what? You're fat and bald. That's what happens
when you get older. Look at me, I'm just a brain in a jar!

307
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,199
Self, self, self, self, self!

308
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,434
- We've gotta find out what's going on?
- (KRYTEN) This is our only bottle of real wine.

309
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,314
We've been saving it for a special occasion.

310
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,199
And what could be more special than this?

311
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,759
- To the future.
- To the past.

312
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,072
- This is poison, bud!
- Haven't you anything better than this hogwash?

313
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,629
- We're used to the best!
- Kryten, we're epicures now.

314
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,555
We travel through history
enjoying the very best time has to offer.

315
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,751
Dolphin sweetmeats, roast suckling elephant,

316
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,914
baby seal hearts stuffed with dove pate.
Food fit for emperors!

317
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,512
(LISTER'S BRAIN) We've socialised with all the greatest figures
in history - the Habsburgs, the Borgias...

318
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,389
Why, only last week, Louis XVI
threw a banquet especially in our honour.

319
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,757
The man is a complete delight -
urbane, witty, charming...

320
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,319
He was an idiotic despot who lived in the most obscene luxury
while the working classes starved in abject poverty.

321
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,912
- Well, we certainly didn't see any of that when we were there.
- And his wife's an absolute cutie.

322
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,994
I think they're our favourite hosts.
If you don't count the Hitlers.

323
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,187
The who?!

324
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:11,194
Providing you avoid talking
politics, they're an absolute hoot.

325
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,075
- You're good friends with the Hitlers?!
- It's just a social thing.

326
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,074
We don't talk about his work.
We just have a few laughs, play Canasta

327
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,039
and enjoy the odd game of
mixed doubles with the Goerings.

328
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,313
- I don't believe what I'm hearing!
- Look, you have to understand,

329
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,903
we travel back and forth
throughout the whole of history.

330
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:31,350
And naturally, we want to
sample the best of everything.

331
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,839
It's just a bit unfortunate that the finest things tend
to be in the possession of people judged to be a bit dodgy.

332
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,395
Hermann Goering is "a bit dodgy"?!

333
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,152
What has become of you all? You've abandoned your
morals, been seduced by power and wealth.

334
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,517
All you're interested in now
is indulging your carnal desires.

335
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,599
And could we tell you some stories about that!

336
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,759
I don't recognise any of you.
You're just amoral self-serving scum,

337
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,911
freeloading your way through history!

338
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,199
Good grief! I can't believe I used
to be such a stuck-up, pompous prig.

339
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,676
(EXPLOSION)

340
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,356
OK. That's it.
You've got two minutes to get off this ship.

341
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,515
I don't know how we became you, but I sure as hell don't
intend to help you carry on doing what you're doing.

342
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,190
But we need to examine the calibration on
your time drive's mass compactor.

343
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,617
That's one minute forty...

344
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:25,315
Shooting us, will be like killing
himself in the future. He won't do it.

345
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,151
- What have I got to lose? My jar?
- Gentlemen, let's meander back, why don't we?

346
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,113
But without the calibration data, we'll be
stranded out here in the middle of nowhere.

347
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,675
- Fifty seconds.
- (CAT) Come on, let's go!

348
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,217
You'll change your mind
when you've thought it through.

349
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:44,200
You are destined to become us,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

350
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,749
In the end, you'll help us.

351
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,156
Twenty seconds. Into the airlock. In, git.

352
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,209
I knew it would be a
mistake to see the future.

353
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:10,760
Now our whole lives will be coloured by the fact
that we're gonna end up becoming people we despise.

354
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,072
Threat warning. Vessel off the stern. They've got a missile lock on us.

355
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,954
- Our future selves are attacking us!
- They're nuts!

356
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,158
- Direct hit. The gyroscope's out!
- They're trying to disable us!

357
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,078
- Another lock!
- Incoming message!

358
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,153
Gentlemen, we have no intention
of being deprived

359
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,312
of the opulence of luxury the time drive provides.

360
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,237
Either you give us access to the data we require
or be prepared to be blasted out of the sky.

361
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,911
- But if you kill us, then you'll cease to exist.
- Better that than be forced to live like you,

362
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,031
like rats trapped together, marooned
in deep space. Your answer, 30 seconds.

363
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,794
- What do we do?
- Have we got any chance of winning?

364
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,958
Their craft is greatly upgraded.
We have no chance whatsoever.

365
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,118
- Then I say fight!
- Mr Rimmer?!

366
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,870
- Better dead than smeg!
- Yes! Cat?

367
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
Better dead than sofa sized butt.

368
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,479
- Kryten?
- Better anything than that toupee!

369
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,150
- Shields up. Arming lasers.
- Bringing her around.

370
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,709
- Target acquired.
- Locking on... Firing!

371
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,639
- Direct hit!
- Starbug thrusters! Nice shooting, sir!

372
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,719
- Bringing her round for desserts.
- Threat warning, they've got a lock-on.

373
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,916
- I'm going for the main fuel tanks.
- They're in your sights.

374
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,356
- Locked on... Fire!

375
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,751
- Mr Lister!
- Is he OK?

376
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,073
- He's dead, sir!
- The hull's gonna go. We'll all be dead in a minute.

377
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,192
(RIMMER) Cat!

378
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,076
Dead. But there may be a...

379
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,593
Kryten? Kryten?

380
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,754
There may be a what? A way out of this? Is that what you were going to say?

381
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,756
S-speak, Kryten!
How can we change what's happening?

382
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,591
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

383
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,991
# I'm all alone, more or less

384
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,278
# Let me fly far away from here

385
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,080
# Fun, fun, fun

386
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,029
# In the sun, sun, sun

387
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,318
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

388
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,632
# Drinking fresh mango juice

389
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,997
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

390
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,879
# Fun, fun, fun

391
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,670
# In the sun, sun, sun

392
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,559
# Fun, fun, fun

393
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,759
# In the sun, sun, sun #
