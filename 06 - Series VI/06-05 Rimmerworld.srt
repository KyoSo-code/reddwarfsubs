("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, that's finished the test, sir.
We just have to while the Navicomp processes the results.

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,160
Unfortunately, I have had to allow for the
fact that you cheated at your eye tests.

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,880
- What do you mean, cheated?
- There's no point in lying, sir.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,120
You crept in here last night, knowing you were going to
have a medical, and you copied the eye charts onto your shoes.

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,080
I admit I may have taken a peek, but
I'm a competitive man, Kryten. Always have been.

7
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,240
- That's what makes me what I am.
- We're all perfectly well aware of what you are, sir.

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Oh, the results.

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,120
Everything ticketyboo?

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,880
Would you like to take a seat for a moment, sir.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
- Problem?
- You don't have any next of kin, do you, sir?

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,400
No, they all died of heart attacks.

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,440
Not just heart attacks -
aneurysms, strokes, brain clots, you name it.

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,633
Are you of the school that, when faced with bad
news, prefers to hear that news naked and unvarnished

15
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:43,000
or are you of the ilk that prefers to live in happy
and blissful ignorance of the nightmare you're facing?

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,560
Ignorance every time.

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, sir! You've come storming
through your medical with flying colours.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,240
- See you next time.
- Everything's OK, then?

19
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,600
Absolutely peachy.

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
- I want to know Kryten, if there's something's wrong.
- If there was something wrong, sir, I would tell you.

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,020
- Even if I'd asked you not to?
- Well, no. In that case I would lie,

22
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:07,720
and tell you everything
was absolutely peachy.

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,680
Kryten, I want to know, that's why I asked for
a medical in the first place. Is there bad news?

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,360
Lie mode cancel.
Yes, sir. I'm afraid there is.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,200
I knew it. It's the headaches, isn't it?
And the heart palpitations, and the blackouts,

26
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,320
the chest pains and the voices,
it's something to do with that isn't it?

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Sir, when you died, you were
recreated as a hologram.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,920
Your exact personality was refined to
an algorithm and duplicated electronically.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,400
If that algorithm contained a flaw, that flaw would be duplicated also.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
- Flaw?
- It's not common,

31
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,040
but it's possible for a hologram to die.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,375
Kryten, kindly get to the point, before
I jam your nose between your cheeks

33
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,640
and make it the filling
of a buttock sandwich.

34
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,789
As a result of both
genetics and environment,

35
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:52,120
you are particularly prone to
stress-related nervous disorders,

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,634
and your activities over
the past couple of years

37
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:57,800
have pushed your brain to, well
frankly, beyond breaking point.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,760
(WHEEZES AND HYPERVENTILATES)

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,120
Your T-count, which is the hologrammatic
equivalent of blood pressure,

40
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,080
is higher than a hippy on the
third day of an open-air festival.

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,480
If you wish to avoid
a gigantic electronic aneurysm,

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,440
it is imperative that you start on a program of relaxation.

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,398
I see. And you thought the best way
for me to start this program of relaxation

44
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,760
was to tell me my brains
are about to explode.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
You've got the bedside manner
of an abattoir giblet gutter.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,880
Here's what I suggest.
Try and avoid all stressful situations.

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,160
Spend more time in your hard light form
and take a little exercise. And here...

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,840
Use these Chinese worry balls
whenever you feel anxious or tense.

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,480
Hey, maybe some good
news. Come and check it out.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,448
Er... Kryten, I don't want
the others to know about this.

51
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:51,240
I want you to behave as if
everything's absolutely normal.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,640
As you wish, sir.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,600
- There she blows.
- Logging onto the ident computer.

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,718
What's this?

55
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:07,640
We've come across that simulant
ship we totalled a couple of weeks back.

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,920
We're gonna try and board it for supplies.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,680
Is that wise, sir? The scan says the superstructure's
highly unstable and could go at any time.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,734
What if some of the
simulants have survived?

59
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:20,280
There's an old Cat saying,
"If you're gonna eat tuna, expect bones."

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,600
There's an old human saying,
"If you're gonna talk garbage, expect pain."

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,880
- Look, we'll take our chances man, OK?
- No K.

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
They're cybernetically-deranged
mechanical killing machines.

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,691
Not content with blasting
their ship out of the sky,

64
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:37,880
you now want to go back and steal
what remains of their belongings?

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,560
That's the metaphorical equivalent of flopping
your wedding tackle into a lion's mouth

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,808
and flicking his love spuds
with a wet towel. Total insanity.

67
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,871
Look, ever since that
refrigeration unit packed in,

68
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:55,680
we've had to live off a few pathetic handfuls
of moss and fungi scraped off passing asteroids.

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,138
I can't stand it any more.

70
00:04:57,162 --> 00:05:01,080
Sir, are you really saying you'd rather
have a psychopathic mechanical killer

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,280
rip off your skull and play your
frontal lobes like a xylophone

72
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,040
than have another bowl
of my nourishing space nettle soup?

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
Buddy, I'd hand him the sticks
and hold up the sheet music.

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,120
Lister, they are simulants.
Why on Io should they have food supplies?

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,000
Because the ident computer
says they do. Look...

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,760
- Stocked to the gills.
- It's true, sir.

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,200
Rogue simulants carry large stocks of food supplies in order
to prolong the torment of their torture victims.

78
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,320
In some cases, they've kept subjects alive
for over 40 years in a state of perpetual agony.

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,640
If we wanted to live in a state of perpetual agony,
we'd let Lister play his guitar.

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,040
- We don't. I say drive on.
- Kryten, what's for dinner?

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,960
Tonight, sir, asteroidal lichen stew
followed by dandelion sorbet.

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,960
We're going in.

83
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,760
Sir, can't you see
your behaviour is totally irrational?

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,200
In which case, we can remove him from duty
as per Space Corps Directive 196156.

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,360
196156? "Any officer caught sniffing
the saddle of the exercise bicycle

86
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,960
"in the women's gym
will be discharged without trial"?

87
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,640
Hmm. Sorry, sir, that doesn't quite get
to the nub of the matter for me.

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,240
Sir, we have enough thistles and weeds and cultured fungus
for you to scrum yourself stupid until the day you die.

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
This foolhardy trip beggars logic.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,280
Lister, we'd be fools not to listen to him. When is he ever wrong?

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,800
Alright, he may have a head shaped
like an inexplicably popular fishing float,

92
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,520
but he does operate from a position of total logic,
and we'd be fools to ignore his sage counsel.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,367
At least let me and
Mr Rimmer go in your place.

94
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:44,600
We are after all, merely electronic
life-forms and therefore expendable.

95
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,800
And what the smeg would
you know, bog-bot from hell?

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,520
There's something else.
I didn't want to say in front of the Cat.

97
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,972
The reserve fuel tank got punctured
when we crashed into that ocean moon.

98
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:58,840
If we don't re-supply, we're
out of power... two, three days.

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,800
- But what about the readouts?
- I rigged the readouts, I didn't want to cause any alarm.

100
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
You rigged the readouts? You didn't want to cause any al- ?

101
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
(WHEEZES) I can't breathe!
I'm hyperventilating!

102
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,800
- Please, sir, don't panic.
- It's not panic, it's a full-blown hysterical fit!

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,320
Grind those balls, sir! Grind them!

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,200
So, let me get this straight. If we board
that ship and get captured, we're finished.

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,000
However, if we board that ship, don't get captured, but the
superstructure disintegrates around us, we're finished.

106
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,960
On the other hand, if we board that ship, don't get captured
and the superstructure doesn't disintegrate around us...

107
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,760
but we can't find any fuel, we are in fact finished.

108
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,400
- That's about the shape of it, yeah.
- After you with the balls, sir.

109
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,400
Look, we're out of options. We've got less choice
than a Welsh fish and chip shop.

110
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,280
We've got to board that ship, even if it is on the brink of disintegration.

111
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,680
Just pray the crew are rotting in Silicon Hell along with all the photocopiers.

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,320
- Look, you three go. I'm not leaving Starbug.
- Fine, that's fair enough.

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Unless of course something weird
and hideously ironic happens,

114
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,406
like, while we're away, you get boarded by a
rampaging torture party of crazed simulants

115
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,400
in the rabid grip
of bloodlust fever.

116
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll go and pack.

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,200
Bring your extra brown rubber safety pants.

118
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,280
And your hard light remote belt.
We need all the hands we can muster.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
(RAPID BEEPING)

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,218
Life signs.

121
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,440
One of those suckers bumps
into me, he'll be lunching on laser.

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,080
Last time we met I was wearing the same outfit,
and no one's gonna survive to tell that story.

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,880
Listen guys, I suppose now's
as good a time as any to tell you.

124
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,400
- Tell us what?
- We can't actually use the bazookoids.

125
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,120
They're for psychological reasons only.

126
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,240
Look, the scan says the superstructure is so unstable that
even a loud noise could start a shipquake.

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,760
That's why I skipped chillies for breakfast.

128
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,120
- Why are you all looking at me like that?
- Like what?

129
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,960
- Like I'm a nostril hair in a Spanish omelette.
- Why didn't you tell us?

130
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
- I didn't want to cause any panic.
- You didn't want to cause any p-...?!

131
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
(WHEEZES)

132
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,400
Let me get this clear my head. If we meet one
of these totally deranged killing machines,

133
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
we have to engage them in combat silently?

134
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,976
What do we do? Whisper "Charge", tippytoe
up to them all screaming "shhhhhh",

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,880
and chloroform them
with Lister's armpits?

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Priceless.

137
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,560
- A teleporter.
- Hmm. Fully functional.

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,560
- Let's grab what we gotta and load up.
- Quietly.

139
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,800
(RUMBLING)

140
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,680
It's not gonna hold much longer, sir. We better make this the last batch.

141
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,960
One more trip, Kryten. Let me get one more crate
of that red-hot West Indian red pepper sauce.

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,640
Shh!

143
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,400
Well, if it isn't my old friends,
the human vermin,

144
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,720
the scabrous slime, the pus-sucking,
puke-laden walking cesspits of unspeakableness.

145
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,320
She remembers us.

146
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,720
Annihilated my ship, slaughtered my fellow
simulants and you practically destroyed me.

147
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes, I remember you.

148
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,560
One thing you should know - last time we met, I was wearing a cute little black number with peach trim and gold spangles.

149
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,628
And although this looks like
I'm wearing the same outfit today.

150
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:44,560
It is in fact an entirely
different cute little black number

151
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,400
with completely different gold spangles.

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,541
That was an important speech,
sir, and it needed to be made,

153
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:55,316
but might I suggest that from this moment on, the
rest of this discourse is conducted by those

154
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,560
with brains larger than a grape.

155
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Take it away, bud.

156
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,040
OK, let's knock on the door and ask for Ronnie Real.
This is a classic stalemate situation.

157
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,880
You can't use your weapons and neither can we.

158
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,320
So, let's chalk this one down to experience,
and we'll be on our merry way, yeah?

159
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,280
Actually, as far as psychotic, deranged, ruthless
killer simulants go, you're a bit of a babe.

160
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,720
- What are you doing tonight?
- Dying.

161
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,720
- Care to join me?
- Hey, come on. Let's just talk, OK?

162
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,280
We didn't start any of this,
and I think that maybe NOW...

163
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,880
is a good time to sit down and parley.

164
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,920
Let's not hang around, just get on with it.

165
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,680
There is nothing for us to discuss.
In 60 seconds, you'll be dead.

166
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,760
- You can't be serious.
- I'm totally serious.

167
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,320
I don't believe you're being serious.

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,240
I do not understand why you're having
such problems grasping this concept.

169
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm a totally ruthless, amoral killing machine,

170
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,400
so why, in the name of all that's putrid,
don't you believe I'm serious?

171
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I'll say this once more.
You've still got a chance to change your mind.

172
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
Think about it. Everything we've been through.
Does none of that mean anything to you?

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,440
(CRASHING)

174
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,720
Cheers, Rimmer! He's started a shipquake!

175
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,600
- The superstructure's disintegrating!
- The teleporter!

176
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,360
I must warn you, sir, the teleporter's
not calibrated for human tissue.

177
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,920
There's a 20% chance you'll be
turned inside out when you materialise.

178
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,520
Let me check my lining.
Innards and lavender, I can carry that off.

179
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,960
- (CAT) What's this?
- Don't you remember, sir. This is a week last Thursday.

180
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,480
In the panic, I must have made a programming error.

181
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,848
For goodness sake, Kryten!

182
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:49,400
Don't you know how rude it is to burst in on
an earlier version of yourself without warning!

183
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,760
You've made our day totally surreal now. I'm very cross!

184
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,160
Pardon my paradox, it's just that the simulant ship you're about to encounter-

185
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,600
We don't want to know what we're about to encounter!

186
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,200
Don't compound your temporal faux pas
by telling us our future.

187
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,760
Where's the rangy, handsome one?

188
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,520
What, you? You scarpered in that escape pod,
you slimy, triple-faced, back-stabbing Judas.

189
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,840
Ah! I'm safe, then? Thank God for that.

190
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,400
Don't talk to them! Oh! You see what you've done
now? Just get back to your own damn time line!

191
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,960
- Here we go.
- Well, be you later.

192
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
Let's get out of the landing bay! It's gonna blow!

193
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,520
All in all, 100% successful trip.

194
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
But, sir, we lost Mr Rimmer.

195
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,160
All in all, 100% successful trip!

196
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,720
- I can't believe he did that, not even Rimmer.
- Sir, I didn't get the opportunity to tell you before,

197
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,480
but earlier today I discovered Mr Rimmer is suffering
from a stress-related nervous disorder.

198
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,800
Next time I see him, he'll be suffering
from a fist-related teeth disorder.

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,120
- Incoming message.
- My escape plan worked, then?

200
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,528
What escape plan?

201
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,200
The valiant plan whereby I set
off the disintegration of the ship's hull

202
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,560
by bravely leaping into the escape pod,
thereby creating a diversion, so you could...

203
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,600
- Actually, how DID you escape?
- The teleporter.

204
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,920
That wasn't the only way, but as good as any I suppose.

205
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,640
Still, I'm sure no one's forgetting the sheer manliness and
stiff-upper-lippedness of the diversionary part of the plan,

206
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,080
and to hasten with all speed the recovery
of the modest hero of the hour.

207
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,320
- Actually, Flash, that might be a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

208
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,120
You're accelerating away from us way above our top speed.

209
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,281
I've logged into your
ident computer, sir.

210
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:48,960
Rogue simulants looted the pod from a colonisation
seeding ship constructed in the 25th Century

211
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,480
There are no controls as such, it is programmed to take you to the nearest planet with an S3 atmosphere.

212
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,560
- How long is it going to take to get me back?
- Well, let's see shall we?

213
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Checking the local area. Er... no, nothing there.

214
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,960
Going to mid-range... Er, still nothing.

215
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,240
Going to long-range...

216
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,200
Long-Long-range...

217
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,240
Long-long-long-range.
Ah, here we have it, just computing.

218
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,280
- Well? How long?
- Have you still got those Chinese worry balls, sir?

219
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,000
- Yes.
- Well, start grinding them like you've never ground before.

220
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,680
- How long?
- Let me tell him, Kryten.

221
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,320
- How long?
- A year and a half.

222
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,920
That's ridiculous! You've got to find a way of getting me back!

223
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
Well, we could try and bring you down
with a round from the laser cannon, sir?

224
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,480
Form an orderly queue behind the gun sight.

225
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,840
- Another way!
- Sir, there are no other options.

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,160
Wait. Something's happening. Course change.

227
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,920
Check. Your guidance system's
found a nearer S3 planet.

228
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,480
It's taking you through
that wormhole at 495-372,

229
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
That's a lot better, you should make planetfall in four days.

230
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Isn't there some sort of time-dilation
problem when you go through a wormhole?

231
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,280
Well, yes there is. Since you're travelling
through a compressed space,

232
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,560
time will move more swiftly for the
object passing through the wormhole.

233
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,840
One minute on this side of the wormhole
will represent many years on the other.

234
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
So, is that good?

235
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Balls on standby, sir.

236
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,400
- More than a year and a half?
- Er, yes, sir. A little more.

237
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,480
- How much more?
- Well, let's not beat around the bush - a lot more.

238
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,072
Kryten, that's still beating
about the bush. Just tell me.

239
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, remember that medieval
war, sir, that lasted quite a long time?

240
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,120
- The Thirty Years' War?
- No, not that war, sir. The other one.

241
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,280
- The Hundred Years' War?!
- Now take that figure and multiply it by six,

242
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
then you'll come up with your golden number, sir.

243
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,280
- Six hundred years?!
- Pinch me!

244
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
We're losing contact, any minute.

245
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,640
Six hundred years with just myself
as company? I'll go raving mad!

246
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,480
There's an old Cat saying...
but you don't want to hear it right now.

247
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,320
On the upside, according to your inventory
the pod's stocked with solar accelerators.

248
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,520
That should keep your hard light drive
going for as long as you need.

249
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,759
As the pod was looted
from a seeding ship,

250
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:08,480
there may even be emergency terraforming equipment
on board. Possibly even at a genetic capability.

251
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,040
But I'll never survive.
I'm not the Robinson Crusoe type.

252
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,276
I'm lousy at woodwork,
i'm no good in the wild.

253
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,140
Do you know, when I was at school, it
took me five terms to make a tent peg.

254
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,240
How long is it going to take me to build a two-storey
home with running water and a balcony/sun patio?

255
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Six hundred years?
I won't even have finished planing the wood!

256
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,560
Losing contact any second.
See you in eight lifetimes.

257
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,640
One last word, sir - remember your condition.
Whatever, try and avoid stressful situations.

258
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,000
Whatever befalls you, try and greet it with a
smile on your face and a song in your heart.

259
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,960
You are a total, total
complete and utter, total, complete and total-

260
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
- Well, he's gone.
- So, what do we do now?

261
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,960
Nothing we can do,
I know for a fact there's no champagne.

262
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Our side of this time dilation phenomena it will appear as if Mr Rimmer is gone for just a few hours,

263
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,760
but from Mr Rimmer's point of view, he will have to wait
six entire centuries for us to reach him.

264
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,800
To hell with the champagne,
we can celebrate with urine recyc.

265
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,560
This is the personal log
of Space Corps hard light hologram Arnold J Rimmer.

266
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,040
Day 1: After landing, I ventured forth to
explore the place I would be calling home

267
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,080
for the next two thirds of a millennium.

268
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,160
A desert planet, the only life-forms - the most
basic single-celled protozoa - and me.

269
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,760
Relationships would be difficult,
but not impossible.

270
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
I repaired to the pod
to appraise the supply situation.

271
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,960
The pod had indeed been looted
from a seeding ship.

272
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,000
Among the supplies, I found two strange
devices labelled "eco-accelerator rockets".

273
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,920
I held out little hope that they might
improve my lot, but launched them anyway.

274
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,880
For six days and nights, the entire
planet was wracked with storms,

275
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,400
the like of which I had never
witnessed before or since.

276
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,240
Then, just as suddenly, they stopped.

277
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,920
In just six days, I had created
my own world, lush and verdant.

278
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,400
I had created Rimmerworld,

279
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,520
I was Adam in my own Eden,
and only one thing was missing - my own Jane.

280
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,800
As I studied the pod's textbooks,
my excitement grew.

281
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,760
It seemed entirely possible for me
to create a fully grown female clone

282
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,560
using my own DNA as a template.

283
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,000
This, of course,
created the most enormous moral dilemma.

284
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Technically, she would be my sister, and therefore
unable to take me as her lover.

285
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,480
After much soul searching,
I reluctantly decided.

286
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,720
What the hell? I just wouldn't tell her.

287
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,240
After months of careful nurture,
the cocoon cracked.

288
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,000
Something had gone hideously wrong.

289
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,600
The clone was just an identical copy of me.
I went back to the manuals and tried again.

290
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,080
There she blows, an S3 planet.

291
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,800
Navicomp locked. Entering atmosphere.

292
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,280
Got something.
Try quadrant four-niner-seven-two.

293
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,240
- According to the scan there's life signs.
- Confirmed. Thousands of them.

294
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,040
Either Mr Rimmer had the incredible good
fortune to land on a populated planet, or...

295
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,160
- Or what?
- It's too hideous to contemplate.

296
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Preparing to land.

297
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,240
- Wait. Nasal alert!
- What, you're getting something?

298
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,360
I sure am. My nasal hairs are quivering like
an opera singer's bosom on the high notes.

299
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,280
- Halt, abomination!
- Rimmer?

300
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
- Silence, travesty.
- Rimmer?

301
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,800
Never have I seen such a hideously
formed and unnaturally freakish deviant.

302
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
Rimmer?!

303
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,960
Silence, mutant! How dare you stand there
and address a norm using that face!

304
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,360
It's a revolting insult against nature.

305
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,960
This might sound like a bit of a corny line, but...
I can't even bring myself to say it.

306
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,920
Say what?

307
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,040
- Take us to your leader.
- Oh, sir, how could you?

308
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,520
Let the Great One judge them.

309
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,680
Who disturbs our royal snooze?

310
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,160
- Rimmer? It's us.
- Dear lord, what created such foulness?

311
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Is this the product
of a marriage 'twixt woman and gerbil?

312
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,120
Don't you remember, 600 years ago? We used
to be your shipmates. We've come to save you.

313
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,600
We found them in the woods,
Your Flared-Nostrilness

314
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,520
and have brought them here
to be tried as travesties.

315
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,360
That ain't goalpost-head.
He doesn't smell right.

316
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,160
Agreed, he scans as organic, not hologram.

317
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,440
The "H" is an affectation,
possibly it has become a symbol of power.

318
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,080
These deformed monsters
are no sight for my concubines.

319
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,120
My treasures of pulchritude, run along.

320
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Avert your eyes from her great beauty.

321
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,000
(GRUNTS) Let the trial begin
before my jacuzzi water grows tepid.

322
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,920
These three abominations stand charged
on eight counts of gross deviancy.

323
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,480
Not content with not looking like The True Image,
they flaunt freakish behaviour

324
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,200
such as charm, bravery,
compassion and... honour.

325
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,000
Are there no signs of normalcy in these wretches?

326
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,240
No cowardice or pomposity?
No snideyness or smarm?

327
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,280
Not even basic honest-to-goodness
double-dealing two-facedness?

328
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,040
Sire, these creatures did not even attempt
to sell each other out for their own freedom.

329
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,160
They lack even the most basic natural drives.

330
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,320
- How do you plead?
- Sir, we wish to speak to the hologram known as Rimmer.

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,000
I am he!

332
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,560
Not so. We are seeking the creator of your race,
the father of your people,

333
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,920
the first true Rimmer,
the template for your species.

334
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,240
Enough of this heresy. At the stroke of dawn,
take them out and kill them.

335
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,760
And when you've killed them, burn the bodies,
then bring me the cold ashes on a silver plate...

336
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,840
with a glass of chilled Sancerre.

337
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,360
This guy's an animal. Doesn't he know
it's red wine with cold ashes?

338
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,560
- Rimmer?
- Smell checks out.

339
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,120
That truly is old toilet-brush hair himself.

340
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,920
Of course! I remember.

341
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,840
Custer! Derek Custer!

342
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
Kit!

343
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,200
Titan!

344
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,778
What's happened to him, bud?

345
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:25,960
How long have you been in here, sir?
In this god-forsaken dungeon pit from hell.

346
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Speed count mode...

347
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
557 years?!

348
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,512
What, you've been stuck
here in this cell all that time?

349
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:38,920
- What happened?
- Can you imagine a society composed entirely of me?

350
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm trying not to. The last time I did that,
it took me a week to dry the mattress.

351
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,360
Thousands upon thousands of back-stabbing,
treacherous, hypocritical, cowardly slime-mongering Judases.

352
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,400
They overthrew me. And when they found out
they couldn't damage my hard light drive,

353
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,120
they locked me in here so I could never threaten their insane lust for power.

354
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,760
Look, bud, can understand them locking you up, but what
have they got against me, Derek and Titan?

355
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,324
Anyone who deviates
from the template is reviled.

356
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:13,560
The smallest physical flaw and
they're banished from society.

357
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,200
Anyone who displays behaviour deemed "out of
character" or "un-Rimmerlike" is punished by death.

358
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,720
Is that why no one on the planet is brave,
sexy, noble or charming?

359
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,760
- All crimes here.
- Man, I must be public enemy number 1, 2 and 3.

360
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,600
But sir, don't they realise the only way any society
can evolve through mutations in the gene pool.

361
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,760
When there is no richness or variety, congenital
disorders and inherited lunacy are commonplace.

362
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,600
Who can forget the famously insane European monarchies
of the 19th and 20th centuries?

363
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,280
- Oh, what have I created?
- Your very own personal hell.

364
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,440
Well, fun though it's been hearing
about your 500 years of total misery,

365
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
shouldn't we be making skedaddle plans?

366
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,240
I, for one, could not bear the prospect of being
burned alive. Flames and peach? Ooh, I'd rather die!

367
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,839
Have you tried
escaping, Rimmer?

368
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,480
The whole planet is populated
with back-stabbing slimeballs.

369
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,600
The minute I got out, I'd be sold back immediately.

370
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,200
There's got to be a way out. There hasn't been
a prison built that can hold Derek Custer.

371
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,400
Why don't we scrape away this mortar here,
slide one of these bricks out,

372
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,520
then using rope weaved from strands
of this hessian, rig up a kind of pulley system,

373
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,255
so then when the guard comes
in here, he sets off a trip wire,

374
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,760
gets laid out, then we put
Rimmer in the guard's uniform,

375
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:36,500
he leads us out. We steal some swords, and fight our way back to the 'Bug?

376
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Or we could use the teleporter.

377
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,920
Or, at a pinch, we could use the teleporter.

378
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,080
I've done it again! Two anomalies in one day.

379
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,760
I must have accidentally tapped
into the previous calibration.

380
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,828
Sorry, about this, it's just we're
escaping from Rimmerworld...

381
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,720
Don't tell them that. They
don't want to know the future.

382
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,440
Poor old Rimmer doesn't want to know he's about to get
persecuted for six centuries by a load of his own clones.

383
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,337
Careful, bud. For a minute there,
I thought you were going to let slip

384
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,360
that he spends the next 557
years locked in a dungeon.

385
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,880
- Rimmerworld?
- I'm saying nothing, man.

386
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,440
- Don't want to spoil the surprise.
- Rimmerworld was weeks ago.

387
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,720
We're far more concerned at the moment about the
quite hideous thing that's happened to Lister.

388
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,520
- He's right bud, where are you?
- Yeah, where am I? I wanna know!

389
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,960
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

390
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,400
# I'm all alone, more or less

391
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,720
# Let me fly far away from here

392
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,520
# Fun, fun, fun

393
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,360
# In the sun, sun, sun

394
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,840
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

395
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,080
# Drinking fresh mango juice

396
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,480
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

397
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,400
# Fun, fun, fun

398
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,120
# In the sun, sun, sun

399
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,920
# Fun, fun, fun

400
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,040
# In the sun, sun, sun #
